# Assessment and Strategic Considerations Regarding the Neutralization of Vivianne I

**Introduction**

The entity known as Vivianne I poses a significant threat to the stability of our reality and the integrity of the Sandbox, a parallel dimension used for divination purposes. As a powerful necromancer and Oathbreaker, her actions have already caused considerable harm, and her continued existence could lead to catastrophic consequences. This paper will assess the potential methods for neutralizing Vivianne I, analyze the associated risks and benefits, and propose a strategic course of action, taking into account new information regarding the defenses of her phylactery.

**Methods of Neutralization**

1. **Entrapment within the Blight of Entropy:** Liadon, a visitor from another reality, has proposed using the Blight of Entropy, a powerful artifact with a connection to the Xetahr bloodline, to entrap Vivianne I's spirit. This method could potentially neutralize her without the risk of her transferring to a clone. However, it would also grant TGI (The Great Intelligence) access to the "random seed" that Vivianne I possesses, potentially strengthening the entity and increasing the threat it poses to our reality. It is important to note that this method requires access to the phylactery to release Vivianne I's spirit.
    
2. **Destruction of Phylactery:** As an archlich, Vivianne I's soul is bound to a phylactery. Destroying this phylactery would sever the link between her soul and her physical form, effectively ending her existence. However, this method carries significant risks. Liadon has suggested that Vivianne I has a contingency plan in place, involving a clone that her soul could potentially transfer to upon the destruction of her phylactery. This could lead to a protracted conflict with a potentially more powerful version of Vivianne I.
    
3. **Direct Confrontation and Destruction:** A direct confrontation with Vivianne I could lead to her destruction, but this is a high-risk option. Vivianne I is a formidable opponent with vast magical powers and a loyal following. Engaging her directly could result in significant casualties and collateral damage. Additionally, this method does not guarantee the destruction of her phylactery, leaving the possibility of her resurrection open.
