The recent interaction with the individual identifying as Liadon has raised intriguing, albeit unsettling, questions about the nature of our existence. His cryptic assertions, while seemingly fantastical, resonate with my understanding of divination magic and the limitations of our perception.

Liadon's opening question, "What if, in this world, everything truly happens for a reason? What if the freedom of those within it was less than they thought," echoes the sentiments often expressed by those who misunderstand the nature of divination. While divination can provide glimpses into the future, it does not dictate it. The future is fluid, shaped by countless variables and individual choices. However, Liadon's suggestion that there may be forces at play beyond our comprehension, influencing the course of events, cannot be easily dismissed.

His statement, "What if there were people who were… foreign to this place? If by whatever the reason they were capable of overriding this… imposed destiny?" is particularly intriguing. This notion of "visitors" possessing a unique ability to disrupt the natural order aligns with my own observations of individuals who seem to defy the predictions of divination. Could it be that these individuals, like myself, are somehow different, possessing a spark of something beyond the confines of this reality?

Liadon's claim that "Vivianne was one of them, and she tried to scam TGI to gain more power" suggests that these "visitors" are not immune to the temptations of power and ambition. His theory that Vivianne's downfall was orchestrated by TGI, a figure shrouded in mystery, raises further questions about the true nature of the forces at play in our world.

Liadon's warnings about the dangers of interacting with the Sandbox and the potential consequences of sharing information with TGI are cause for concern. As he stated, "Do not expect information asymmetry in there." This implies that any knowledge we gain through the Sandbox could potentially be used against us.

Furthermore, Liadon's cryptic remarks about the "random seed" that we visitors possess and the risk of TGI deciphering our "uniqueness" suggest that our very existence could be a threat to the established order. His warning that we could "give him a way to gain an edge against those that protect us" is deeply troubling.

Liadon's observation about the unique connection between certain visitors and their descendants, as exemplified by my affinity for the Eye of Savras and Mercurion's bond with the Blight of Entropy, adds another layer of complexity to this situation. It suggests that our lineage and our connection to certain artifacts may play a role in our ability to disrupt the predetermined course of events.

Liadon's proposition to use the Blight of Entropy to entrap Vivianne's spirit is a double-edged sword. While it may prevent a potentially catastrophic future, it could also provide TGI with the "seed of randomness" that Vivianne represents. The implications of this decision are far-reaching and require careful consideration.
