# Lament of Fallen Guardians

In depths unseen, where silence reigns, 
The guardians stood, wardens of chains. 
But darkness whispered, a tempting call, 
And golden hearts began to fall.

A figure emerged, a spectral queen, 
With promises of power, a twisted scene. 
Her words, like venom, seeped and spread, 
As light succumbed to shadows dread.

The guardians yielded, their wills entwined, 
In darkness' embrace, their souls resigned. 
Their radiance dimmed, their purpose swayed, 
As shadows danced where sunlight played.

A noble heart, once pure and bright, 
Offered as fuel for endless night. 
Life's essence drained, a sacrifice made, 
To feed the hunger of a spectral blade.

With power stolen, the queen arose, 
A symphony of death, her presence froze. 
Lost souls now echo her haunting song, 
As shadows lengthen, forever strong.

The guardians wander, forever bound, 
In darkness' grip, their spirits wound. 
Their light extinguished, their path unseen, 
Lost to the echoes of what might have been.
