**Entry 1: Team

- Team
	- **Azaki:** _"Brooding. Sketchy. Owns the teleport device. Claims only he can use it. Sure, Jan. Keep an eye on him (and his Eldritch Blast). Also, why does he stare so much?"
		- Also, ask if his teleport device doubles as a coffee machine.
	- **Lenore:** _"Shape-shifter extraordinaire, but right now, it’s all about blending in. Great at thingamjigs. If she starts mimicking my face again, I’m demanding hazard pay."_
- Targets:
	- **Owen:** _"Master of foresight. Cold, calculating, brilliant. He plays the long game, always. Reminder: Don’t underestimate him—it’s like trying to out-think a library."_
	- **Flare:** _"Fire incarnate, in every sense. Merged with lich queen, and now a force of nature* . Watch her music—it’s not just notes, it’s power."

*( * scary but... hot... literally hehehe)

**Entry 2: The Plans**

- **Plan A: "Capture the Spark."**  
    _"We get Flare or Owen subdued. Azaki teleports us out. We get the info out of them. Minimum drama, maximum results. Reminder: don’t let them talk too much; they’ll outmaneuver us."_
    
- **Plan B: "Sneaky-Sneaky."**  
    "Disguise ourselves as staff. Find inner quarters. Get to Owen/Flare's living spaces. Ask _very_ pointed questions. If caught, blame Azaki. Bonus points if we figure out what's in the vault (and take it)"
    
- **Plan C: "Chaos Is a Ladder."**  
    "~~IMPROVISE~~. All bets are off. Azaki still teleports us out, but not before we make enough noise to distract the entire Cause for weeks. Bonus points for leaving some of their fancy gear ‘misplaced.’"

**Entry 3: Notes**

- "Dragons > Liches, but Flare > Both. Just saying."
- _"The Cause hoards secrets like dragons hoard gold. Speaking of dragons—remember: their disappearance is really what kicked it all off. If Flare or Owen knows anything, we _must_ extract it."
- _"If She admits them as Guardians of the Planar Balance... We must succeed."_
- Ursula is really scary, and her girlfriend is even scarier. The Crescent Flame are weirdos.
