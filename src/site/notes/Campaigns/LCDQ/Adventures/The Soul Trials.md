## Adventure log

### 21/10/09
**Where:** Market square (in front of the Hall of Ceremonies), City of Almarrosa, the Sandbox.
**Who:** Alythra, ~~Asahi~~ ~~Azuki~~ Azaki, Demmanu, Killian, Soror Millie.
**And also:** Med (disguised), Lady Alessandra Diamante, Korris, Rhea Circulus (mentioned), Galda Cavaglieri (the juggler)

- Med's projection into the Sandbox disappears right before Millie's eyes
	- They leave her with a note that says "I'm okay - But be careful, who's the enemy, really?"
- With the disappearance of what was the shopkeeper of the unusual store that contained keepsakes of everyone's memories, some of the folks decide to try and retrieve the items that reminded them of their past
- Another shopkeeper, who will later reveal herself as Alessandra Diamante, spots the party trying to (according to her) steal from one of the stalls, and decides to call the guards.
- Although Alythra, who is still holding some of the drow priestess robes, is tempted to resolve the situation through violence, the fact that the rest of the group seems to be pretending to be unrelated to the situation leads her to more creative tactics: pretending to be a shopkeeper
- Given her rigid drow training, her performance as a shopkeeper is less than desirable, but Azaki jumps in as a shop assistant and the guards ignore them, starting to head towards Miss Diamante to enquire why they were called.
- To distract them, Dem decides to create a fire magically over some burlap sacks that were laid over the stairs - but Lady Diamante seems to notice, and uses that as an excuse to approach them and ask for an explanation: who are they? where did they come from? are they going to the ball?
	- Alessandra Diamante, a jeweller, explains that all of the stalls have been waiting for the attendees of the ball to come - as they are nobles who will likely have a lot of purchasing power to drop coin in their stores.
	- She also mentions that there hasn't been anyone new - well, with the exception of that weird lady who seemed to collect all sorts of random keepsakes for her shop.
	- After inspecting her, Millie observes that Alessandra seems to belong to a different era, an elf of classical features who dresses in the fashion of pre-colonial human eras. She also doesn't seem to wear any religious symbols she recognises.
- Hearing about the ball, the party decides to try and find a way to get in. Dem, bored of socialising, decides to go on ahead and start scouting.
	- He sees that the ball is called "The Dance of the Eternal Threads", and the tagline reads "Where souls follow the pattern of the cosmos, and the threads of destiny reveal the hidden truth"
- Millie pulls Killian aside to try and understand what happened to him when he died, and why does he have that strange glyph/line in his face. Killian says he doesn't remember anything but a light and a voice, and that he assumes he must have never actually died, or that maybe it wasn't possible in this dreamlike dimension.
	- Initially, Millie isn't particularly convinced about this, but she can't read Killian at all, and suddenly reads about a book that calls her attention for a reason she cannot really remember. The book is titled "Adella's personal diary"
- Alythra goes around the market looking at the different stalls. That Diamante lady mentioned that the odd shopkeeper had been collecting items connected to people, so there is a possibility that there might be more things to look for. She finds some daggers that oddly enough make her think of a red-haired woman. She's trying to see if there are other points of connection with the locals to try and find a way to get insights about the ball.
	- She also find a man, who she later learns goes by the name of Korris, who she has the vague impression to know from her past life.
	- This man offers her a puff of something, and Alythra accepts. She experiences boundless beauty, true clarity, and joy for the world... until she doesn't. She now has a hunger that not much will satiate, ever.
	- He recognises her and remembers her name, but he isn't sure of much more. Korris mentions that little by little all that he knew has been slowly eroding, and he just remembers three things: that he shouldn't have come in the flesh, that you can only leave this place by boat (and there have been any for a very long time), and that those who enter the ball never come back. Not that any of them would be invited.
- As Alythra breaks the news to the rest of the team they are all now set to enter the ball, whatever means necessary. Dem goes to the entrance to scout the working staff that might be around - and spots that all of the employees seem to be dressed in a pink and purple uniform. 
- Dem also sees that they seem to be using a bracelet and some sort of combination to pass through the gate. Aware of his lack of... sleight of hand, he decides to query the team for someone more skilful in the arts of "property redistribution". 
- Millie and Azaki team up for the task, the latter in charge of distraction. It seems that there is a halfling juggler who is entertaining the folks at the square, and they decide to make her the target.
	- Pressed to act, Azaki decides to flirt with the juggler, who seems to be enchanted by his square shoulders, his breathtaking height (for he is, well, human), and his smooth talking. 
	- When she accepts his proposal to going to a more private space to "continue with the juggling lessons", Millie states that as Azaki bodyguard, she needs to do a quick pat down before she can let them go together. The juggler questions this, but lets her proceed anyway.
	- Graceful and stealthily, Millie removes the personnel wristband from the juggler. 
- Before they can celebrate their triumph, they realise that the juggler has just suggested to Azaki that they go to her private quarters... inside of the City Hall.
- In the meantime, Killian has wandered around the market square, looking for any signs of his own past and memories. Whether he found anything will be revealed... in the next episode.
