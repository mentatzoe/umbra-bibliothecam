## Hunt Log

### Hunt 1: 

**Monster:** Zenobia Bellairs, Undead Witch

**Background:** Zenobia Bellairs studied necromancy to live beyond death and is now an undead monster hiding in her old house, preying on unwary tenants. She can only leave her secret chamber (her tomb) between midnight and 1am — "The Witching Hour." She was armed with a Hand of Glory.

**Hook:** The team was reporting on the mysterious clock-filled "haunted" house that Zenobia's heir had been unable to sell due to its cursed reputation.

**Investigation:** Some kids who had broken into the house became zombies — as did a sexy reporter Brad had made contact with.

**The Undead Witch:**
- Powers: Consume (harm she inflicts fuels her existence), Summon Human Minions, Creature of Darkness
- Weakness: Can only be killed if the Clock of Endor is destroyed
- Cannot cross running water; rock salt forces her back to her tomb

**Resolution:** They defeated Zenobia and took her artifact: **The Hand of Glory** — the dried and pickled hand of a hanged man, which when lit with a candle made from the corpse's fat can unlock any door, paralyze hostile people, and reveal hidden things. Charles now keeps the Hand.

**Aftermath:** The property fell into legal limbo and couldn't sell, so Brad bought the manor. It now serves as the team's headquarters.

**Key participants:** Brad, Dario, Charles, Winter, Yusuf, Glorb

### Hunt 2:

**Monster:** Kappa 

**Hook:** Winter's tip led the team to investigate Katsuko Mikelson's haunted house.

**Background:** Katsuko Tanigawa had maintained a 70-year deal with a kappa, a Japanese water spirit. After emigrating from Japan and eventually passing away, no one continued leaving offerings at the small suitengu shrine on the lake's edge. The kappa went back to procuring its favorite food: human livers.

**Investigation:**
- Samuel Voss (rich businessman, steel industry magnate) found dead — autopsy by Detective Jones revealed missing organs (liver, intestines) with no wounds
- Strangulation marks from small child-sized hands
- Fish disappearing from the lake since late last year
- Connection to the Lake Committee / Community Centre
- Katsuko's grandmother had cancer; shrine and sea cucumbers involved
- A husband who made a deal that might still come due

**The Kappa:**
- Weaknesses: Sesame, steel (iron), politeness (bowing empties the water from its head-bowl)
- Powers: Ridiculously strong (loves sumo wrestling), aquatic
- Attacks with webbed claws, beaked mouth, and deadly strangle holds

**Resolution:** River crushed the Kappa with his car.

**Possible prophecy connection?**

**Key participants:** River, Prof Archibald, Yusuf, Dario, Charles
