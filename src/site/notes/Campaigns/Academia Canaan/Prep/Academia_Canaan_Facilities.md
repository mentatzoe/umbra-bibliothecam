# Academia Canaan - Facilities & Campus Guide

> *"El campus funciona como una micro-sociedad donde los estudiantes pueden cubrir todas sus necesidades y centrarse en su desarrollo multidisciplinar: atlético, mental, bélico, y social."*

## Overview

Academia Canaan's campus sprawls across the hills near [[Caleborna\|Caleborna]] in the [[About the world/Nations/Kingdom of Sansi\|Kingdom of Sansi]], a self-contained world where future knights, noble leaders, and successors to the [[Vesper Crusaders\|Vesper Crusaders]] are forged. The architecture blends ancient elven design (dating to the Academy's founding over a millennium ago) with practical Sansi stonework added over centuries of expansion.

The campus is organized in concentric rings of increasing prestige and restricted access, with shared facilities at the center and College-specific spaces radiating outward.

---

## Shared Facilities

These spaces are accessible to all students regardless of College affiliation - the common ground where the Academy's diverse community intermingles.

### Ceremonial & Administrative

#### Salón de los Fundadores (Hall of Founders)
The heart of Academia Canaan. A grand hall with vaulted ceilings where portraits of the five [[Vesper Crusaders\|Vesper Crusaders]] watch over all official ceremonies. Massive stained-glass windows depict key moments from the Crusaders' legendary feats.

**Used for:** Opening ceremonies, Selection announcements, formal disciplinary hearings, rare appearances by the Crusaders themselves.

**TSL Potential:** High-pressure social situations; being called here outside ceremonies means trouble. The portraits seem to judge you. Moments of public triumph or humiliation.

#### La Tablilla (The Rankings Board)
A massive slate board in the central courtyard, enchanted to update automatically. Displays team rankings, individual "notes of concern," and College sponsorship status. Students cluster here each morning.

**TSL Potential:** Public shame or validation; watching your ranking drop; seeing a "Concern Note" appear next to your name; the social dynamics of who looks and who pretends not to care.

#### Oficinas del Consejo (Council Offices)
The [[Consejo de Estudiantes\|Consejo de Estudiantes]] operates from a suite of rooms adjacent to the Salón. Ostensibly for "student governance," these offices are where the real power games play out.

**TSL Potential:** Being summoned for "evaluation review"; attempting to petition or manipulate Council members; overhearing things you shouldn't.

---

### Academic Spaces

#### La Gran Biblioteca (The Great Library)
Three stories of accumulated knowledge spanning the Academy's millennium of existence. The main floors are open to all; upper galleries require demonstrated need and faculty approval.

**Contents:** Military history, philosophy of balance, heraldry, diplomatic records, maps of Tinnuith, sanctioned magical theory.

**Restricted Section:** Requires special dispensation. Contains texts on the [[Cataclysm\|Cataclysm]], pre-Lux theology, and "dangerous" philosophies.

**TSL Potential:** Research montages; clandestine meetings in shadowed alcoves; discovering information that changes everything; being caught where you shouldn't be.

#### Aulas Comunes (Common Lecture Halls)
Tiered amphitheater-style rooms where faculty deliver lectures on subjects all students must master: Tinnuith history, ethical philosophy, basic tactics, diplomatic protocol.

**TSL Potential:** Being called on when unprepared; passing notes; public debates that get personal; faculty who see too much.

#### Sala de Mapas (The Map Room)
A circular chamber with a massive relief map of Tinnuith built into the floor, enchanted to display troop movements, political boundaries, and historical campaigns. Used for tactical instruction.

**TSL Potential:** Planning sessions that reveal character; arguments over strategy; seeing the scale of conflicts that shaped your backstory.

---

### Training Grounds

#### El Campo Central (The Central Field)
A vast open training ground for large-scale exercises, team competitions, and public demonstrations. Bleachers line the edges for spectators. This is where rankings are won and lost.

**TSL Potential:** Competitive trials with everyone watching; moments of athletic triumph or failure; the crowd's reaction shaping your reputation.

#### Círculos de Duelo (Dueling Circles)
A dozen sand-floored circles of varying sizes for formal and informal sparring. Academy rules govern duels - they're legal ways to settle disputes, but killing or maiming results in expulsion.

**TSL Potential:** Formal challenges; proving yourself; getting drawn into fights you didn't want; the intimacy of combat revealing character.

#### La Armería Común (The Common Armory)
Training weapons, basic armor, and equipment available to all students. Quality and selection improve based on ranking and College affiliation.

**Equipment Access by Ranking:**
- **Top 3 Teams:** First selection, newest equipment, private storage
- **Middle Teams:** Standard selection, shared racks
- **Bottom 3 Teams:** Whatever remains, often damaged or ill-fitting

**TSL Potential:** Resource scarcity creating conflict; the humiliation of poor equipment; someone sabotaging your gear.

#### Establos y Campos de Monta (Stables & Riding Fields)
Extensive stables housing horses, war ponies, and more exotic mounts (griffons for advanced riders, donated by noble families). Riding is a core knightly skill.

**TSL Potential:** Bonding with animals; competition over mount assignments; the stables as a quiet place for private conversations.

---

### Social Spaces

#### El Gran Comedor (The Great Hall)
Where students take meals together - in theory. In practice, the meal hierarchy ensures this is another arena of competition.

**Meal Hierarchy System:**
- Teams are called to eat in ranking order
- Top teams eat first while food is hot and plentiful
- Bottom teams eat cold leftovers
- Lowest-ranked team must serve the others before eating

**TSL Potential:** Daily humiliation or validation; the politics of where you sit; being forced to serve people you despise; finding solidarity with fellow low-ranked teams.

#### Los Jardines del Crepúsculo (The Twilight Gardens)
Beautiful gardens designed to be most stunning at sunset - a nod to the Vesper Crusaders' twilight symbolism. Popular for walking, reflection, and clandestine meetings.

**TSL Potential:** Romantic encounters; private conversations; beauty that contrasts with the Academy's harsh competition; a place to be vulnerable.

#### La Plaza del Estudiante (Student Plaza)
An open courtyard with benches, a fountain, and small vendor stalls run by students for extra privileges. The informal social hub.

**TSL Potential:** Gossip central; casual encounters that become significant; the economy of favors and information.

#### Capilla del Ocaso (Chapel of the Sunset)
A non-denominational sacred space for reflection and prayer. Features an altar that catches the setting sun's light dramatically. Some students find peace here; others find it unsettling.

**TSL Potential:** Crisis of faith moments; seeking guidance; confessions (overheard or genuine); the weight of what you've done.

---

### Residential

#### El Preámbulo (The Preamble Building)
The deliberately shabby dormitory for postulants during their 10-day trial. A clear message: you haven't earned comfort yet.

**Features:**
- Rooms designed for 4-5 people but containing only 3 beds
- Shared bathrooms, often cold water
- Thin walls (privacy is not a right)
- Located at the campus edge, far from amenities

**TSL Potential:** Forced intimacy with teammates; sleep deprivation; overhearing other teams' conflicts; the nightly negotiation of who gets a bed.

#### Residencias de los Colegios (College Residences)
After acceptance, students may choose to live in their College's dedicated housing or in mixed residences. College dorms offer comfort and community; mixed housing offers broader connections.

**TSL Potential:** The choice of where to live revealing priorities; being the outsider in your own College's space; cross-College friendships that complicate loyalties.

---

**TSL Potential:** Confronting your cultural biases; representing something you're not; finding unexpected connection across difference.

---

## Restricted & Forbidden Areas

These spaces are off-limits to most students. The reasons vary from practical danger to institutional secrecy.

### Faculty Quarters & Crusader Residences
The [[Vesper Crusaders\|Vesper Crusaders]] maintain private quarters on campus, though they're rarely present. Faculty housing is similarly restricted.

**Access:** Forbidden to students without explicit invitation.

**Rumors:** Students whisper about what the ancient elven knights keep in their rooms - artifacts from their legendary feats, perhaps, or evidence of their true nature. Some say the Crusaders haven't aged in a millennium. Others say they're not the originals at all.

**TSL Potential:** Forbidden encounters with legendary figures; discovering your heroes are flawed; being invited somewhere you shouldn't go.

### Las Cicatrices (The Scars) - Abyssal Infection Ruins

> ⚠️ **RESTRICTED AREA - AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY**

In the eastern woods lie the ruins of a building consumed during the [[Cataclysm\|Cataclysm]] - one of the few places where Abyssal corruption took physical root on the material plane. The infection was contained but never fully cleansed.

**Official Status:** Actively forbidden. Warning signs, magical wards, and regular patrols.

**What's There:** Twisted architecture that doesn't obey normal geometry. Stone that pulses with wrongness. Whispers at the edge of hearing. A feeling of being watched by something that shouldn't exist.

**Connection to Team 8:** [[Oria Cicatriz\|Oria Cicatriz]], born near an Abyssal rift, feels a pull toward Las Cicatrices. The corruption calls to what's already inside her.

**TSL Potential:** Confronting cosmic horror; being changed by what you witness; forbidden exploration that has consequences; discovering the Academy's dark foundation.

### Los Susurros (The Whispers) - Haunted Corridors

In the oldest part of the Academy, certain corridors and rooms have... residents. Students tell stories.

**The Stories Say:**
- A student who died during a duel walks the halls at midnight, still looking for their opponent
- In the old dormitory wing, you can hear crying from a room that no longer exists
- The portrait gallery sometimes shows faces that aren't on any canvas
- If you speak a name in the Chapel at sunset, someone will answer - but it might not be who you're looking for

**Official Status:** Acknowledged through rumor. Faculty neither confirm nor deny. Some students avoid certain areas; others seek them out.

**TSL Potential:** Encounters with the dead; being haunted by guilt made manifest; spirits that know things they shouldn't; the boundary between memory and ghost.

### La Grieta (The Crack) - Hidden Underdark Entrance

Beneath the Academy's oldest cellars, behind a wall that looks solid, lies a passage downward. Very few know it exists.

**What It Is:** An entrance to the Underdark - the vast subterranean realm where [[Root Elves\|Root Elves]], remnants of devil-touched peoples, and other survivors of Llerathian persecution fled.

**Who Knows:** Perhaps an old faculty member, a student who found it by accident, members of [[About the world/Organisations/The Way of the Tiger\|The Way of the Tiger]] who use it as part of their underground railroad.

**Official Status:** Hidden. No warnings because officially it doesn't exist.

**TSL Potential:** Discovering escape routes and their implications; meeting people who shouldn't be here; moral choices about who you protect and who you report; the Academy's secrets beneath its surface.
