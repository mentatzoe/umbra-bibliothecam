# El Preámbulo - Onboarding & College Challenges

> *"Todos juntos, o ninguno en absoluto."*

## The Three Layers of Evaluation

The [[Consejo de Estudiantes\|Consejo de Estudiantes]] has designed El Preámbulo as a multi-layered evaluation system. Postulants face:

1. **Formal Trials** - Official challenges with clear rules and public outcomes
2. **Ongoing Observation** - Everything is being watched; daily behavior matters
3. **Secret Tests** - Situations designed to reveal character when you don't know you're being tested

This creates a pressure cooker where postulants can never fully relax, never know what "counts," and are constantly performing for an audience they can't see.

## Onboarding Structure

### Day 1: Arrival & Sorting

#### Ceremonia de Inauguración
**Location:** [[Salón de los Fundadores\|Salón de los Fundadores]]
**Led by:** [[About the world/People/Inés de Ribarrosa\|Inés de Ribarrosa]] (President) and the [[Consejo de Estudiantes\|Consejo de Estudiantes]]

The formal welcome ceremony establishes the stakes:
- The Academy's sacred mission (forging guardians of balance)
- The five [[Colegios Mayores\|Colegios Mayores]] and their values
- The "todos o ninguno" rule - complete teams are accepted or rejected together
- Introduction of the 10-day trial period

**What's Really Happening:** The Council is already observing. How do you react to the speech? Who do you look at? Do you flinch when they mention teams living or dying together?

#### Asignación de Equipos
**Led by:** [[About the world/People/Colmillo de Hierro\|Colmillo de Hierro]] (Treasurer)

Teams are announced. This is presented as administrative efficiency; it is actually surgical cruelty. Each team composition has been designed for maximum dramatic potential.

**Team 7 (The PCs):** Assembled by Inés's personal interest. She knows the threads connecting these five people - the hunt, the deaths, the imprisonment, the guilt. None of them know they share this history. Watching them orbit each other unknowingly is her entertainment.

#### Introduction to El Preámbulo
**Location:** [[El Preámbulo\|El Preámbulo]] building

Teams are shown their quarters and given the rules:
- 3 beds for teams of 4-5 (figure it out)
- Shared bathrooms, often cold water
- Lights out at designated hours
- You may not leave the building after curfew

**First Night Tensions:** Deliberately designed. The missing beds force immediate negotiation. The thin walls mean your team's conflicts become everyone's knowledge.

---

### Day 2: Orientation

#### Morning: Campus Tour
Teams are given guided tours of campus facilities, establishing what they can access and what they cannot. Access is stratified by ranking (which they don't have yet - they start at the bottom).

**What to Emphasize:**
- The Rankings Board (La Tablilla) - empty for now, soon to be filled with their fates
- The Great Hall's meal hierarchy - they'll experience it at lunch
- College facilities glimpsed but not entered - that must be earned
- Forbidden areas mentioned in passing (Las Cicatrices gets a significant warning)

#### Afternoon: Evaluation Criteria Briefing
**Location:** Common Lecture Hall
**Led by:** Faculty representatives from each College

Each College explains what they look for in candidates. This is both genuine information and misdirection.

| College | Stated Criteria | Hidden Criteria |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Armonía** | Perception, balance, harmony with nature | How you handle contradiction; do you force resolution or hold tension? |
| **Gracia** | Grace, adaptability, subtlety | What you do when no one's watching; your relationship with secrets |
| **Vigor** | Strength, endurance, courage | Endurance under social pressure, not just physical; protecting others at cost to yourself |
| **Concordia** | Communication, diplomacy, bridge-building | Whether you build bridges for others or just yourself; genuine vs. performed connection |
| **Verdad** | Knowledge, logic, pursuit of truth | What truths you choose to pursue and which you avoid; intellectual courage |

#### Evening: First Meal
The teams experience the meal hierarchy for the first time. As newcomers with no ranking, they eat last. The food is cold. Other teams watch. This is intentional.

---

## The Formal Trials

Each College administers one formal trial during El Preámbulo. These are scheduled across Days 3-8, giving teams time to prepare and recover between challenges.

**Important:** Teams don't choose which trials to attempt - all teams face all trials. But each College evaluates performance through their own lens. You might "fail" Vigor's trial but impress a Vigor observer with how you handled failure.

---

### Trial of Armonía: "El Equilibrio Roto" (The Broken Balance)

**Day:** 3
**Location:** Cámaras de Observación (modified for the trial)
**Overseen by:** Serenidad Cristalina / Brunhild (Armonía Council rep)

#### The Setup
Teams enter a magically altered space where the environment is in deliberate disharmony - light sources flicker erratically, sounds echo from wrong directions, the floor slopes imperceptibly. Within this space, a simple task must be completed: transport a fragile object from one end to the other.

#### The Catch
The disharmony reacts to the team's emotional state. Conflict, frustration, or fear makes the environment worse. Calm, cooperation, and acceptance make it manageable. The object is deliberately too awkward for one person to carry.

#### What Armonía Observes
- Who panics and who centers?
- Do they fight the environment or adapt to it?
- Can they find balance together, or do some members destabilize others?
- What happens when someone drops the object? (Blame vs. problem-solving)

#### Hidden Test
One team member receives secret instructions that their individual trial score depends on the object breaking. Do they sabotage the team? Resist the temptation? The Council watches what happens - and what the team does if they discover the saboteur.

#### TSL Potential
- The environment responding to Conditions creates visible stakes for emotional states
- Forced cooperation reveals relationship dynamics
- The betrayal element tests loyalty vs. self-interest
- Physical closeness (carrying something together) creates intimacy

---

### Trial of Gracia: "La Máscara y el Espejo" (The Mask and the Mirror)

**Day:** 4
**Location:** El Salón de las Sombras
**Overseen by:** Valentina Diamante (Gracia Council rep)

#### The Setup
Each team must navigate a social scenario: a simulated diplomatic reception where other participants (upper-year students and faculty) play roles. The team has objectives to accomplish - extract information, make connections, avoid certain topics - while maintaining their cover as "visiting dignitaries."

#### The Catch
Each team member receives a secret personal objective that may conflict with the team's goals. Additionally, the "guests" at the reception include at least one person who knows something true about each team member and might reveal it.

#### What Gracia Observes
- Adaptability when plans go wrong
- How they balance personal objectives vs. team needs
- Grace under pressure when someone almost exposes them
- Who covers for teammates and who throws them under the carriage

#### Hidden Test
"Dina Barranquina" (actually Valentina in disguise) from Team 9 is present, documenting everything for her social experiments. Additionally, certain conversations are staged to reveal information that tests emotional control - mentioning events that might connect to a team member's past, for instance.

**For Team 7:** Someone mentions "that terrible hunting accident near Caleborna - two deaths and a young man imprisoned." The Council watches their faces.

#### TSL Potential
- Social maneuvering is pure Entice/Figure Out territory
- Personal objectives vs. team loyalty creates String-worthy conflicts
- The threat of exposure raises emotional stakes
- Performing false identities highlights who you really are

### Trial of Vigor: "El Peso del Otro" (The Weight of Another)

**Day:** 5
**Location:** El Campo Central + Las Forjas del Cuerpo
**Overseen by:** Syliel Faelor (Vice President, Vigor rep)

#### The Setup
A relay endurance challenge. The course includes running, climbing, swimming, and carrying heavy loads. Standard military-style obstacle course - but scaled to be completable, not designed to break everyone.

#### The Catch
At the midpoint, one randomly selected team member is "injured" (magical effect that makes one leg unable to bear weight). The team must complete the second half of the course while supporting this member. They cannot leave anyone behind.

#### What Vigor Observes
- Raw physical capability matters, but isn't everything
- How they handle the "injured" member - resentment or support?
- Do the strong carry others or abandon them?
- Does the "injured" member ask for help or refuse it?
- What happens when the team is exhausted and patience frays?

#### Hidden Test
The selection of who gets "injured" isn't random - it's chosen to maximize tension. The strongest physical performer is often chosen, forcing the team to work without their expected carrier. Alternatively, someone already struggling is chosen to see if the team protects their "weakness" or expresses frustration.

#### TSL Potential
- Physical Conditions (Exhausted, Injured) create mechanical pressure
- Carrying someone creates literal, physical intimacy
- Strength isn't just muscles - it's also emotional endurance
- The Beast playbook shines here, but non-physical characters face their fears

---

### Trial of Concordia: "El Tratado Imposible" (The Impossible Treaty)

**Day:** 6
**Location:** La Cámara de Tratados
**Overseen by:** Inés de Ribarrosa (President, Concordia rep)

#### The Setup
A simulated negotiation. The team represents one faction; another team represents an opposing faction. They must negotiate a resolution to a conflict with no clear "right" answer - resources that can't be divided evenly, historical grievances that can't be fully addressed, needs that genuinely conflict.

#### The Catch
The scenario is designed so that complete success for both sides is impossible. Someone must compromise or lose something. The question is: who, and how?

#### What Concordia Observes
- Can they find creative solutions?
- How do they handle genuine conflict with no easy resolution?
- Do they build relationships even with opponents?
- Is their diplomacy genuine or manipulative?
- What happens when they have to deliver bad news to their "people"?

#### Hidden Test
Midway through negotiation, each team receives private information that changes the stakes dramatically. How they handle asymmetric information - and whether they share it honestly - reveals character.

**For Team 7:** Inés is directly overseeing this trial. She may introduce "new information" that references events suspiciously close to their shared history. She's testing whether any of them will crack.

#### TSL Potential
- Negotiation is social combat - Strings and leverage are everything
- Being forced to compromise reveals priorities
- Losing gracefully is harder than winning
- The opposing team might become allies - or enemies

### Trial of Verdad: "Lo Que No Está Escrito" (What Is Not Written)

**Day:** 7
**Location:** Los Archivos Profundos (limited access granted for trial)
**Overseen by:** Colmillo de Hierro (Treasurer, Verdad rep)

#### The Setup
A research challenge with a mystery structure. The team receives fragments of historical information about an event in the Academy's past. They must piece together what happened using the Archives' resources, then present their conclusions.

#### The Catch
The historical event has been deliberately obscured. Some records are missing. Some contradict each other. Some are outright falsified. The "truth" they're seeking has been actively suppressed by the Academy itself.

#### What Verdad Observes
- Analytical skills and pattern recognition
- How they handle contradictory evidence
- Do they accept the first plausible answer or dig deeper?
- How do they present uncertain conclusions?
- What do they do when they discover uncomfortable truths about the institution they're trying to join?

#### Hidden Test
The event they're researching has parallels to current Academy dynamics - perhaps an earlier version of the Council's manipulation, or a previous team destroyed by secrets. If they dig deep enough, they'll find implications about how El Preámbulo has always worked.

**Bonus Test:** Colmillo de Hierro makes a bet with himself about whether anyone will discover a specific buried detail. If they do, he's privately impressed but publicly dismissive.

#### TSL Potential
- The Seeker playbook's core territory - uncovering hidden truth
- Discovering uncomfortable things about where you are
- The tension between truth-seeking and self-preservation
- Research as intimacy (working closely in the Archives)

---

## Ongoing Observation

Beyond formal trials, the Council evaluates constantly. Every interaction is potential evidence.

### What They're Watching

#### Morning Rankings
- Who checks La Tablilla first thing?
- How do they react to their position?
- Do they celebrate others' failure or just their own success?

#### Meal Dynamics
- Who helps lower-ranked teams, if anyone?
- How do they behave when serving others?
- Conversations overhead during meals

#### Training Ground Behavior
- Practice habits when no formal evaluation is occurring
- Who helps teammates vs. focuses only on personal improvement
- Interactions with other teams - competition or camaraderie?

#### Evening Common Areas
- Social dynamics when exhausted
- Who isolates and who connects
- Romantic or intimate connections forming
- Conflicts and how they're resolved

### The Informant Network

The Council has eyes everywhere:
- **Team 4 (The Indebted):** Multiple team members report to different Council members
- **Upper-year students:** Some genuinely mentor; others report back
- **Faculty:** Not all are Council allies, but some share information
- **"Dina Barranquina":** Valentina herself, embedded in Team 9

#### Information Flows To:
- **Colmillo de Hierro:** Betting odds, tactical analysis, statistical patterns
- **Valentina Diamante:** Scandals, secrets, content for the student paper
- **Serenidad Cristalina:** Emotional vulnerabilities, spiritual struggles
- **Syliel Faelor:** Training progress, physical capabilities, who protects whom
- **Inés de Ribarrosa:** Everything. Especially anything about Team 7.

## Secret Tests

These are situations that don't look like tests. The postulants don't know they're being evaluated.

### "The Dropped Notebook"
A faculty member or upper-year student "accidentally" drops a notebook containing compromising information. Does the postulant who finds it return it unopened, read it, share it, or use it?

### "The Struggling Competitor"
A member of another team is clearly struggling - emotionally, physically, or academically. Do they offer help to a competitor? Ignore them? Exploit their weakness?

### "The Forbidden Shortcut"
Word spreads that there's a way to gain advantage in an upcoming trial - but it requires breaking a minor rule. Who takes the shortcut? Who reports the ones who do?

### "The Overheard Secret"
A postulant "accidentally" overhears Council members discussing something they shouldn't know - perhaps about team compositions, or evaluation criteria, or another team's hidden weakness. What do they do with the information?

### "The Accusation"
Someone accuses a team member of something they didn't do. Does the team defend their member? Investigate themselves? Throw them to the wolves?

### Team 7's Personal Secret Test
Throughout El Preámbulo, small details surface that connect to the hunt that links them:
- A newspaper clipping about "rising hunting accidents"
- An offhand comment about "that werewolf situation in the provinces"
- A research topic in the Archives that touches on pack justice
- Someone mentioning a witch's garden destroyed by fire

The Council is watching. Do any of them react? Do any of them connect the dots? Do any of them look at their teammates differently?

## Evaluation Mechanics

### The Rankings Board

Updated every morning, publicly displayed:

1. **Team Standing (1-9):** Overall ranking based on trial performance and observation
2. **Individual Notes:**
   - ⭐ "Showing Promise" - Public positive attention
   - ⚠️ "Of Concern" - Public negative attention (soft social death)
3. **College Sponsorship Status:**
   - Each College can publicly "express interest" in individuals
   - This can be withdrawn - public humiliation

### Consequence Escalation

| Ranking | Consequences |
|---------|--------------|
| **Top 3** | First meal, best equipment, private practice times, comfortable beds |
| **Middle 3** | Standard access, normal conditions |
| **Bottom 3** | Last meal (cold), worn equipment, shared/limited practice, potential bed loss |
| **Consistent Bottom** | Team Probation - restricted access, increased surveillance, warning marks |

### Warning Marks
- Issued for rule violations, conflicts, or "concerning behavior"
- Three marks → Called before the Council for "Evaluation Review"
- Review can result in: Warning, Probation, or Early Elimination Threat

### The Early Elimination Rumor
A whisper circulates that teams can be cut before Day 10. Is it true? The Council neither confirms nor denies. The fear is enough.

## What the Council Wants to See

Despite all the manipulation, the Academy genuinely is trying to select future knights. The Council is looking for:

### Team Qualities
- Genuine cohesion that survives pressure
- Complementary strengths covering individual weaknesses
- Loyalty that doesn't become blind
- Ability to disagree productively

### Individual Qualities
- Character that holds under pressure
- Growth when confronted with failure
- Self-awareness about strengths and limitations
- Alignment with a College's values (genuine, not performed)

### Red Flags
- Betraying teammates for personal gain
- Cruelty without purpose
- Rigidity that can't adapt
- Selfishness disguised as strategy
- Breaking under pressure in ways that endanger others

The irony: the Council's manipulation means they're testing whether people can maintain good character while being actively sabotaged. It's unfair by design. They want to see who stays decent anyway.
