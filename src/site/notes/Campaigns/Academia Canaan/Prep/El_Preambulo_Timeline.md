## Day 1: Arrival — "Bienvenidas"

### Morning: Arrival at Academia Canaan

**Scene:** Postulants arrive throughout the morning. Some come by carriage, some on foot, some through more unusual means. They gather in the courtyard before the [[Salón de los Fundadores\|Salón de los Fundadores]].

**What to Establish:**
- First impressions of each other
- The intimidating beauty of the campus
- Upper-year students watching, evaluating
- The empty Rankings Board, waiting

**Team 7 Moments:**
- Do any of them recognize each other? (They shouldn't, but bodies remember trauma)
- Ylsa's wolf senses might pick up... something familiar
- Ember's spirit companion reacts to proximity to the others
- Briar clocks everyone as potential marks/threats

### Afternoon: Ceremonia de Inauguración

**Location:** Salón de los Fundadores
**Key NPCs:** [[About the world/People/Inés de Ribarrosa\|Inés de Ribarrosa]], full [[Consejo de Estudiantes\|Consejo de Estudiantes]]

**Scene:** The formal welcome. Inés's speech establishes:
- The Academy's sacred purpose
- The five Colleges and their values
- The 10-day trial structure
- **"Todos juntos, o ninguno en absoluto"**

**Hidden Drama:**
- Inés specifically watches A.K. during key phrases
- The Council evaluates reactions from the stage
- Valentina takes notes on who looks scared

**TSL Beat:** This is a great moment for *Figure Out a Person* on Council members - what do they *really* want?

### Late Afternoon: Team Assignments

**Led by:** [[About the world/People/Colmillo de Hierro\|Colmillo de Hierro]]

**Scene:** Teams are announced. Colmillo reads names with calculated disinterest, tail twitching when he notes something amusing in a composition.

**Team 7 Assignment:**
When their names are called together, emphasize:
- The randomness feels wrong (because it is)
- Inés watches with particular attention
- Do any of them resist being grouped? Accept it? Immediately start assessing teammates?

### Evening: El Preámbulo - First Night

**Location:** The deliberately shabby [[El Preámbulo\|El Preámbulo]] building

**Scene:** Teams discover their quarters - 3 beds, 4-5 people, thin walls, cold water.

**First Night Conflicts:**
- Who gets beds? How is it decided?
- What do they learn about each other from how they negotiate?
- What do they hear through the walls?

**Team 7 First Night Questions:**
- Does Briar immediately start assessing secrets to collect?
- Does Ylsa's protectiveness emerge (deciding to take the floor)?
- Does Ember's spirit companion manifest? Do others notice?
- Does Fay's honesty create friction or clarity?
- Does A.K. try to lead, or hang back?

**Ending Beat:** Lights out. In the darkness, everyone listening. Tomorrow, everything begins.

---

## Day 2: Orientation — "The Rules of the Game"

### Morning: Campus Tour

**Scene:** Faculty lead teams through the campus, showing shared facilities, College exteriors (glimpsed, not entered), and restricted areas (warned against).

**Key Moments:**
- Passing La Tablilla (empty, ominous)
- The warning about Las Cicatrices - "Students who enter without authorization do not return unchanged"
- Glimpsing the Vesper Crusaders' quarters (closed, legendary)
- Other teams sizing each other up

**Team 7 Notes:**
- Ember might sense something from Los Susurros (haunted areas)
- Fay might feel drawn toward El Santuario Verde (Armonía's living garden)
- Ylsa's senses are overwhelmed by the campus's layers of scent and history

### Afternoon: Evaluation Criteria Briefing

**Location:** Common Lecture Hall
**Key NPCs:** Faculty representatives from each College

**Scene:** Each College explains what they value. This is sincere information wrapped in strategic presentation.

**What Teams Learn:**
| College | Public Message | What Observant Characters Notice |
|---------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| Armonía | "We seek those who perceive balance" | The representative seems to be looking *through* people |
| Gracia | "Adaptability and grace under pressure" | The representative notices everything, reveals nothing |
| Vigor | "Strength to protect, endurance to persevere" | Genuine warmth, but assessing physical capability constantly |
| Concordia | "Building bridges between differences" | Political polish; hard to read true intentions |
| Verdad | "Truth, however uncomfortable" | Calculating, watching who reacts to "uncomfortable" |

**Secret Test:** During the briefing, someone mentions "difficult backgrounds" as something the Academy accommodates. Watch Team 7's reactions.

### Evening: First Meal in the Great Hall

**Scene:** The meal hierarchy in action. Teams are called by... no ranking yet. Postulants go last. Food is cold.

**Emphasis:**
- Upper-year teams eating hot food, laughing
- The Council at a raised table, observing
- Team 1 ("The Model Team") already performing perfect harmony
- The physical sensation of eating cold, picked-over food

**Team 7 Questions:**
- Do they complain? Accept it? Plot?
- Do they bond over shared indignity, or fracture?
- Who notices they're being watched?

---

## Day 3: Trial of Armonía — "El Equilibrio Roto"

### Morning: First Rankings Posted

**Scene:** Teams gather at La Tablilla. The first rankings appear - based purely on Day 1-2 observation.

**Rankings (suggested):**
1. Team 1 (The Model Team) - baseline perfection
2-4. Various teams
5-6. Team 7 and others (middle of the pack)
7-9. Teams showing early fractures

**Reaction Shots:** How does each team handle their position?

### Afternoon: The Trial

**Location:** Modified Cámaras de Observación
**Overseen by:** [[Serenidad Cristalina / Brunhild\|Serenidad Cristalina / Brunhild]]

**The Challenge:** Transport a fragile object through a disharmonious environment that reacts to the team's emotional state.

**Team 7 Trial:**
- The environment will respond to their buried tensions
- The "randomly selected saboteur" - who gets chosen? (Perhaps A.K., testing her loyalty)
- Moments where the environment specifically resonates with their hidden connections:
  - A sound like wolves howling when Ylsa is stressed
  - Plants withering when Fay feels out of balance
  - Shadows deepening when Ember's companion stirs
  - Something that sounds like prison doors when A.K. falters

**Climax:** The object almost breaks. What does the team do? Who reaches for it? Who blames whom?

### Evening: Aftermath

- Rankings update based on performance
- Teams process their success or failure
- Secret Test: An upper-year student offers "advice" that's actually probing for weakness

---

## Day 4: Trial of Gracia — "La Máscara y el Espejo"

### Morning: Rankings Update

Movement in the standings. Teams that did well in Armonía rise; those who fractured fall.

**Possible Developments:**
- A "Concern Note" appears next to someone's name
- A College publicly "expresses interest" in a promising individual

### Afternoon: The Trial

**Location:** El Salón de las Sombras
**Overseen by:** [[About the world/People/Valentina Diamante\|Valentina Diamante]]

**The Challenge:** A simulated diplomatic reception. Extract information, make connections, maintain cover as "visiting dignitaries."

**Team 7 Trial:**
- Each member has a secret personal objective
- Someone at the reception "knows something" about each of them:
  - For A.K.: Someone mentions her family name with knowing looks
  - For Briar: A former mark recognizes her style, if not her face
  - For Ylsa: Comments about "beast problems in the provinces"
  - For Fay: Questions about Eldengrothian forest traditions, uncomfortably specific
  - For Ember: Someone asks why she keeps looking at empty corners

**The Bomb:** Midway through, someone casually mentions "that hunting tragedy near here - deaths, imprisonment, such a waste." Watch everyone's faces.

**Climax:** Do they hold their covers? Does anyone crack? Does the team cover for each other or let someone drown?

### Evening: Consequences

- Valentina announces some teams showed "particular promise in social navigation"
- Others showed "concerning gaps in composure"
- Team 7 learns that their reactions were noted, but not what conclusions were drawn

---

## Day 5: Trial of Vigor — "El Peso del Otro"

### Morning: Rankings Update

**Possible Developments:**
- A team has earned "Team Probation" - public announcement
- The meal hierarchy consequences become more visible
- Team 7's position may be precarious

### Afternoon: The Trial

**Location:** El Campo Central + Las Forjas del Cuerpo
**Overseen by:** [[About the world/People/Syliel Faelor\|Syliel Faelor]]

**The Challenge:** Endurance relay. Running, climbing, swimming, carrying loads. At midpoint, one team member is magically "injured."

**Team 7 Trial:**
- Who gets "injured"? Consider:
  - Ylsa (testing if others can function without their strongest)
  - Fay (testing if the team protects perceived weakness)
  - A.K. (testing if she can accept help or needs to lead)

**Physical Intimacy:** Carrying the injured member requires closeness. Hands gripping. Weight shared. Breath synchronized. For characters with tension (Ylsa and attractive women, A.K. and... anything), this is charged.

**Breaking Point:** Someone's grip slips. The injured member almost falls. Does the team catch them? What's said in the moment of exhaustion?

### Evening: Recovery

- Physical exhaustion lowers emotional defenses
- Characters more likely to say true things
- Syliel visits Team 7 (if they performed well) - genuine warmth and assessment combined

---

## Day 6: Trial of Concordia — "El Tratado Imposible"

### Morning: Rankings Update

**The Halfway Point:** Day 6 is when pressure peaks. Rankings feel more real. Teams that were confident are shaken; struggling teams are desperate.

**Possible Developments:**
- The "Early Elimination" rumor reaches fever pitch
- Someone receives a Warning Mark
- A College publicly withdraws interest in an individual

### Afternoon: The Trial

**Location:** La Cámara de Tratados
**Overseen by:** [[About the world/People/Inés de Ribarrosa\|Inés de Ribarrosa]] — personally

**The Challenge:** Negotiation between Team 7 and another team. The scenario has no perfect solution - someone must lose.

**Team 7 Trial:**
- Inés watches with particular attention
- She may introduce "new evidence" that hits close to home:
  - A document about hunting rights and territorial disputes
  - References to families divided by violence
  - Questions about justice vs. mercy
- The opposing team might be Team 9 (with "Dina Barranquina" aka Valentina observing from inside)

**No-Win Moment:** To succeed, Team 7 must sacrifice something genuine - an advantage, a relationship with the other team, or a principle. What do they choose?

### Evening: Inés's Move

After the trial, Inés speaks privately with A.K. Nothing overt - just checking in. But the message is clear: *I see you. I know something. This isn't over.*

---

## Day 7: Trial of Verdad — "Lo Que No Está Escrito"

### Morning: Rankings Update

**Developments:**
- The standings have solidified - it's clear who's likely to succeed and who's in danger
- Team 7's position depends on how Days 3-6 went
- Colmillo de Hierro seems particularly interested in today's trial

### Afternoon: The Trial

**Location:** Los Archivos Profundos (restricted access granted)
**Overseen by:** [[About the world/People/Colmillo de Hierro\|Colmillo de Hierro]]

**The Challenge:** Research an obscured historical event. Piece together truth from fragments, contradictions, and deliberate gaps.

**Team 7 Trial:**
- The event they're researching: A previous team, decades ago, destroyed by secrets they kept from each other. The parallels are not coincidental.
- What they might find:
  - Records of other "specially composed" teams
  - Evidence that the Council has always manipulated compositions
  - A partial list of connections the Council identified between team members
  - Something that makes them wonder about their own team

**The Uncomfortable Discovery:** If they dig deep enough, they find a sealed file on "Team 7 - Composition Rationale." They can't open it. But they know it exists.

### Evening: Processing

- What do they do with what they've learned?
- Do they share the discovery about the sealed file?
- Does anyone start connecting dots about their own team?
- Colmillo de Hierro invites the most observant team member for "an intellectual conversation" - really an interview

---

## Day 8: Rest Day — "The Calm Before"

### No Formal Trial

The official line: Rest and reflection before final evaluations.

The reality: Escalating pressure as consequences accumulate.

### Morning: Final Regular Rankings

This is the "going into Selection" position. Teams know where they stand.

**Possible States for Team 7:**
- **Strong position:** They've bonded, performed well, earned respect
- **Precarious position:** Enough successes to survive but clearly vulnerable
- **Dire position:** Multiple members have Concern Notes, team cohesion fractured

### Day Activities

Without structured trials, the day is "free" - but observation continues.

**Possible Events:**
- **Equipment Access:** Teams can finally use full training facilities - but access is still ranked
- **College Courting:** Representatives approach promising individuals privately
- **Social Maneuvering:** Teams negotiate informal alliances, share information, or sabotage
- **The Rumor Mill:** Whispers about who's definitely out, who's definitely in, all unreliable

### Secret Tests Active

This is when many secret tests deploy:
- The dropped notebook
- The struggling competitor
- The forbidden shortcut
- The overheard conversation

**Team 7's Secret Test:** One of them overhears Council members discussing "the Team 7 situation" - something about "fascinating how none of them have realized" and "the Selection will be... educational."

### Evening: Tension Peak

- Sleep is difficult
- Arguments that have been simmering may explode
- Characters may seek connection (romantic, platonic, or desperate)
- Someone might try something risky - exploring forbidden areas, investigating their sealed file, confronting a Council member

**TSL Moment:** Day 8 evening is prime territory for emotional confessions, Strings being called in, or desperate moves that change everything.

---

## Day 9: The Reckoning — "Todo Sale a la Luz"

### Morning: Something Breaks

Day 9 is when secrets surface. The design of El Preámbulo means that by now, pressure has built beyond containment.

**Possible Triggers:**
- Public confrontation between team members
- A secret revealed (by accident, sabotage, or investigation)
- A team officially fracturing
- Someone breaking a serious rule

### The Team 7 Crisis

This is when the hidden web might start to surface.

**Possible Revelations:**
- Someone mentions A.K.'s brother by name in earshot of Ylsa
- Ember's spirit companion becomes visible to others - and Ylsa recognizes her brother
- Briar's involvement in the scam that started everything is discovered
- Fay finds evidence connecting the fire to specific individuals
- A.K. is confronted directly by Inés about "what she sent her brother to do"

**How Much Surfaces:**
- Probably not the full picture yet
- But enough that they look at each other differently
- Enough that trust is damaged
- Enough that they have to decide: face this or bury it?

### Afternoon: Damage Control or Escalation

**Team 7 Choice:**
- Do they confront the emerging truth together?
- Do they try to contain it until Selection?
- Does someone betray the others to save themselves?
- Does someone sacrifice themselves to protect the team?

### Evening: The Night Before Selection

Whatever happened during the day, they're still together. Tomorrow determines everything.

**TSL Moment:** This is the emotional climax. Conditions should be marked. Strings should be pulled. Characters should say things they can't take back - or things they've needed to say all along.

**Questions for the Night:**
- Do they sleep in the same room?
- Does anyone keep watch?
- Are there confessions? Apologies? Accusations?
- Is there comfort, even if it's complicated?

---

## Day 10: Selection Day — "Todos Juntos, o Ninguno"

### Morning: Final Preparations

**Scene:** The Academy feels different. Upper-year students line the paths. Faculty are visible. The air is charged.

**Team 7's State:**
- Whatever they've become through the past nine days
- Whatever they've learned about each other
- Whatever they've decided to do about it

### The Selection Ceremony

**Location:** Salón de los Fundadores
**Attendees:** All postulants, full Student Council, Faculty, possibly Vesper Crusaders

**Structure:**
1. Rankings are finalized and announced
2. Each College announces which individuals they're accepting
3. Teams are assessed as units - "todos juntos, o ninguno"
4. Those accepted process to their new Colleges
5. Those rejected... leave

### Team 7's Fate

**Depends on:**
- Their performance across trials
- How they handled the Day 9 crisis
- Whether the truth about their connection surfaced
- What Inés wants to happen

**Possible Outcomes:**
- **Acceptance:** They enter as a damaged, knowing team - but they enter together
- **Conditional Acceptance:** They're in, but with marks/conditions/obligations
- **Split Decision:** The rule says "all or none" - but rules can be bent. Does someone sacrifice for others?
- **Rejection:** They're out - but they're out together, and they know who they are now

### Aftermath

Whatever happens, the 10 days have changed them.

**If Accepted:**
- They're now students with full access
- But they carry what they've learned about each other
- And Inés is still watching

**If Rejected:**
- Where do they go?
- Do they stay together?
- What do they do with what they know?

**Either Way:**
- The truth hasn't fully surfaced
- There's still a web connecting them
- There's still a reckoning coming

## GM Notes: Pacing and Flexibility

### Compression
If you need fewer sessions:
- Days 1-2 can be combined (one session of arrival and orientation)
- Trials can be summarized or montaged if the table is eager to reach the crisis
- Days 8-9 can merge (pressure and explosion in one session)

### Expansion
If you want more sessions:
- Each trial can be a full session with prep, execution, and aftermath
- Day 8 is excellent for character-focused side scenes
- The Day 9 crisis can unfold across multiple sessions

### Key Beats to Preserve
No matter how you pace, protect these moments:
1. **The "todos o ninguno" revelation** (Day 1) - establishes stakes
2. **At least one full trial** - experiencing the system
3. **The Day 6 negotiation** - Inés's direct attention on Team 7
4. **The Day 9 crisis** - when secrets surface
5. **Selection Day** - consequences and resolution
