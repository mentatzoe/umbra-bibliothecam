### Overview

**Her Enlightened Enquiry** (commonly abbreviated as **HEE**) is the primary institution within the [[About the world/Nations/Llerathian Empire\|Llerathian Empire]] responsible for the oversight, investigation, and regulation of arcane practices, operating under the direct mandate of the **Illumination Branch** and the ultimate authority of the Goddess [[About the world/Higher powers/Lux Aeterna\|Lux Aeterna]]. Staffed primarily by magically attuned individuals known as **Inquisitors** (the "Enlightened") and protected by specialized **Aegis** personnel ("Shields"), the HEE's core mission is to safeguard the Empire from the perceived destabilizing influence of uncontrolled magic and manifestations of chaos, thereby upholding the divine Order championed by Lux. Its methods and focus have evolved significantly since its inception, particularly following major reforms after the NUL invasion of 55 UL.
 
---

### Mandate and Philosophy

Rooted in Lux Aeterna's core precepts, the HEE operates on the foundational Llerathian belief that uncontrolled magic is a primary gateway to chaos, which threatens the fabric of ordered existence and the well-being nurtured by the Light. The Enquiry's mandate involves:

1.  **Scrutiny of Arcane Practice:** Identifying and investigating any use of magic deviating from the doctrines sanctioned by Lux and the Temple. This includes unsanctioned spellcasting, forbidden research, and the creation or trade of unregulated magical artifacts.
2.  **Containment of Chaos:** Detecting and neutralizing direct manifestations of chaos, whether magical, extraplanar, or ideological in nature, that threaten Imperial stability or the principles of the Light.
3.  **Guidance and Regulation:** Ensuring that all sanctioned magic users (primarily Inquisitors themselves and those within newly established institutions) operate within strict ethical and doctrinal boundaries. The "Enlightened" status implies that only those guided by the Light possess the necessary wisdom and purity to wield magic responsibly.

While historically focused primarily on suppression and control, post-reform philosophy incorporates a degree of **enlightened stewardship**, recognizing the necessity of *understanding* diverse arcane arts (under strict control) to better defend against external threats like the [[NUL\|NUL]]. The core tenet remains that Order, guided by the Light, is paramount for life to thrive safely.

### History

**Founding & Early Years (c. 0 - 39 UL / 991 - 1030 Continental):**
Established in the nascent years of the Empire following the devastating [[Cataclysm\|Cataclysm]] and Abyssal Wars, the Enquiry's initial focus was consolidating Lux's divine Order. This involved identifying and suppressing remnant magical traditions deemed chaotic or heretical from the pre-Lux era, regulating the few sanctioned magic users, and establishing the principle that arcane power required Temple oversight. Early Inquisitors, operating under figures like [[Bel'Dath\|Bel'Dath]], focused on investigation, record-keeping, and enforcement within the newly defined boundaries.

**The Freedom Wars Era (c. 39 - 41 UL / 1030 - 1032 Continental):**
The [[About the world/History/Second War between Llerath and the Free Nations\|Second Freedom War]] against the magic-centric NUL significantly hardened the HEE's stance. Faced with widespread use of "unfettered" magic by the enemy, the Enquiry intensified its internal scrutiny and adopted harsher methods to root out perceived internal threats or sympathies. This era saw Inquisitors like [[Inquisitor Astraea\|Inquisitor Astraea]] gain notoriety for uncompromising, sometimes brutal, enforcement actions, justified internally as necessary measures during wartime to protect the Empire from both external magical assault and internal chaotic corruption. Testimonies from defectors like [[Vanera Demian\|Vanera Demian]] often cite actions from this period as evidence of Llerathian cruelty under pressure.

**Post-NUL Invasion Reforms (56 UL / 1047 Continental onwards):**
The devastating NUL invasion of Llerath in 55 UL, which resulted in the temporary abduction of Lux Aeterna and the death of key figures like [[Bel'Dath\|Bel'Dath]], acted as a catalyst for profound change. The existing methods of the Enquiry were seen as insufficient.
*   **The Shield-Inquisitor Dynamic:** Witnessing Hopeful 7313 ([[Keith\|Keith]]) repeatedly save the life of Hopeful [[Theren Liadon\|Theren Liadon]] during the perilous rescue mission provided the inspiration. Theren conceptualized and championed the formal pairing of magically gifted Inquisitors with dedicated protectors (Shields, or Aegis personnel) trained specifically to defend against both physical and arcane threats, as well as guard against potential corruption.
*   **Expansion of Arcane Knowledge:** Simultaneously, Theren successfully argued that Llerath needed to understand, if not fully embrace, a broader spectrum of magic to effectively counter the NUL's diverse capabilities. This led to the establishment of new arcane colleges under strict HEE and Illumination Branch oversight, dedicated to the controlled study of previously forbidden or ignored disciplines (e.g., Artificery, elemental pacts/Sha'ir tradition, potentially Biomancy) solely for the purpose of strengthening the Empire's defenses and understanding potential threats.
*   **New Leadership:** Theren Liadon was elevated to the newly created position of **Primus Inquisitor**, overseeing the reformed structure and potentially the new colleges, while Keith was named **Primus Aegis**, the leading authority on Shield training and doctrine.

This reform era marked a shift from pure suppression towards a more complex strategy involving controlled arcane development alongside continued vigilance and investigation.

### Structure and Ranks

*   **Leadership:** Operates under the Illumination Branch, ultimately answering to Lux Aeterna. Led operationally by the **Primus Inquisitor** (currently Theren Liadon) and the **Primus Aegis** (currently Keith).
*   **Inquisitors (The Enlightened):** Magically adept individuals rigorously trained and sanctioned by the Temple to investigate, regulate, and utilize arcane powers in service of the Light and Order. They form the core investigative and specialist arm of the HEE.
*   **Aegis Personnel (Shields):** Highly trained protectors assigned to Inquisitors. Skilled in defense, close-quarters combat, threat assessment, and potentially anti-magic tactics, their primary role is the absolute safety of their Inquisitor charge.
*   **Support Staff:** Likely includes scribes, analysts, junior initiates, and potentially specialized units drawn from other Temple branches for specific operations. Hopefuls demonstrating specific aptitudes during training may be earmarked for service within the HEE upon graduation.

---

### Methods and Operations

HEE operatives typically work in paired units of an Inquisitor and their Shield(s). Their methods include:
*   Magical and mundane investigation of suspected heresy or chaotic influence.
*   Scrutiny of arcane research and artifacts.
*   Monitoring borders and internal regions for unauthorized magic use.
*   Neutralizing rogue spellcasters or chaotic entities.
*   Gathering intelligence on external magical threats (particularly NUL activities).
*   Potentially overseeing doctrinal adherence within the new arcane colleges.
*   Providing specialized magical support to other Temple branches when required.

---

### Relationship with Other Branches

*   **Illumination Branch:** HEE is intrinsically part of this branch, acting as its primary investigative and regulatory arm concerning magic.
*   **Intelligence (Beehive):** Close collaboration is essential for receiving and analyzing information regarding potential threats.
*   **Defense (Thorn Council):** Coordination needed for larger enforcement actions or dealing with military-level magical threats. Primus Lemons' position likely facilitates this.
*   **Mind (Sapling Council):** Interaction regarding the definition of arcane doctrine and the educational framework of both standard Temple training and the new colleges.

### External Perceptions

Outside Llerath, particularly within the [[NUL\|NUL]], Her Enlightened Enquiry is widely viewed with fear and condemnation. It is seen as the primary instrument of Llerath's suppression of magical freedom and individual thought, enforcing a rigid, unwanted doctrine through intrusive surveillance and often brutal means. Testimonies from defectors detailing experiences with Inquisitors fuel this perception of HEE as an oppressive, tyrannical force.
