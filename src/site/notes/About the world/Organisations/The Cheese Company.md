#### Overview

**The Cheese Company** is a well-known, if somewhat notorious, adventuring company operating primarily within the [[About the world/Nations/Kingdom of Sansi\|Kingdom of Sansi]] and adjacent territories. Founded in 55 UL by [[About the world/People/Calliope Vanhoutte\|Calliope Vanhoutte]], [[About the world/People/Guan Dao\|Guan Dao]], and [[Dominik Stoch\|Dominik Stoch]], the group quickly gained a reputation for tackling dangerous contracts, getting entangled in significant political events, and surviving perilous encounters through a combination of skill, luck, and often dramatic flair. Their composition has fluctuated significantly over the years, but they are characterized by a pragmatic approach, adaptable methods, and the detailed chronicles kept by founding member Calliope. As of 59 UL, the company continues its adventures, currently focused on investigating ancient artifacts and confronting emerging threats.

#### Profile

*   **Mission Statement/Goal:** The Company does not appear to operate under a single, formal mission statement. Their objectives shift based on contracts, the needs of allies, and the personal quests of its current members. Early goals involved fulfilling mercenary contracts and survival, later evolving to include participation in the [[About the world/History/Sansi Civil War\|Sansi Civil War]] (supporting [[About the world/People/Catalino I, King of Sansi\|King Catalino I]]), investigating supernatural threats like [[Eileithiya\|Eileithiya]], confronting criminal elements like [[Famax\|Famax]], and more recently, pursuing artifacts such as the lycanthropic tiaras and investigating [[Ursula\|Ursula]]'s dangerous experiments.
*   **Beliefs/Values:** The Company operates with a pragmatic and often chaotic ethos. Loyalty within the group appears strong during shared missions, though individual members have departed to follow personal paths. They demonstrate a capacity for both heroic actions (fighting for justice in Sansi) and morally ambiguous ones (infiltration, dealing with underworld figures). Calliope's motto, "We are the Cheese Company and our argument has holes," perhaps best summarizes their self-aware, flexible approach.

#### Story

Founded in **55 UL** by [[Calliope\|Calliope]], [[About the world/People/Guan Dao\|Guan Dao]], and [[Dominik\|Dominik]], The Cheese Company rapidly involved itself in regional affairs. Early adventures (c. 55-56 UL) included surviving an attack by [[Inquisitor Astraea\|Inquisitor Astraea]] at Saunola Path, navigating the complex social landscape of [[Simpa\|Simpa]], investigating a pestilence near [[About the world/Nations/Osterrend\|Osterrend]], confronting a kidnapper **Necromancer** near Cava, hunting [[Zhang Fao\|Zhang Fao]]'s Warfa near [[Maraga\|Maraga]], and infiltrating a dangerous temple/lab where Calliope lost an eye.

**56 UL** proved particularly tumultuous. The Company was deceived by [[Benin Hood Miller\|Benin Hood Miller]] into participating in the **[[Famax\|Famax]] Encounter**, which resulted in the death of their companion [[Laurentius\|Laurentius]]. They also investigated the **haunting of [[Rocamayor\|Rocamayor]]**, uncovering the dark secrets of the aberration [[Eileithiya\|Eileithiya]]. This year also saw Calliope suffer **death** near [[Sencia\|Sencia]] before being revived by [[Mathis\|Mathis]] and [[Dominik\|Dominik]].

From **56 UL to 58 UL**, the Company was heavily involved in the **[[About the world/History/Sansi Civil War\|Sansi Civil War]]**, fighting alongside [[About the world/People/Guan Dao\|Guan Dao]]'s Orc forces in support of [[About the world/People/Catalino I, King of Sansi\|King Catalino I]] against the Barbero faction. Their actions were instrumental in the King's victory.

Following the war (c. **58 UL**), the Company's structure shifted significantly. [[About the world/People/Guan Dao\|Guan Dao]] established himself in [[Sencia\|Sencia]], becoming estranged from the group. [[Dominik Stoch\|Dominik Stoch]] departed on a personal quest after confronting the betrayal of his master, [[Phay Mey (The Mongrel)\|Phay Mey]], during the investigation of the Mongrel's Manor. [[Nak\|Nak]] had also departed sometime prior.

The remaining core members, including [[Calliope\|Calliope]], [[Peace\|Peace]], [[Einar\|Einar]], and [[Alfie\|Alfie]], continued their adventures, focusing on quests like the **Lycanthropic Tiaras** (c. 58 UL onwards).

As of **59 UL**, the Company was involved in investigating the dangerous experiments of [[Ursula\|Ursula]], leading directly to the events surrounding [[Campaigns/LCDQ/The Visitor Trials\|The Visitor Trials]], which saw companions [[Millie\|Millie]] and [[Killian\|Killian]] enter the enigmatic Sandbox dimension.

#### Relationships

*   **Alliances:** Formerly allied with [[About the world/People/Catalino I, King of Sansi\|King Catalino I]] and [[About the world/People/Guan Dao\|Guan Dao]]'s Orc forces during the Civil War. Maintains a working relationship with [[Benin Hood Miller\|Benin Hood Miller]] of [[Las Tres Chimeneas\|Las Tres Chimeneas]]. Has received aid from individuals like [[Mathis\|Mathis]], [[Kemit Enoch\|Kemit Enoch]] (deceased), and [[Olea\|Olea]]. [[Akasha\|Akasha]] and [[Zassath\|Zassath]] offer financial/mission support from Calliope's mansion.
*   **Rivalries/Enemies:** Numerous adversaries have been encountered, including the Barbero faction, NUL forces/agents ([[Void\|Void]], the squad near Sencia), [[Famax\|Famax]], [[Eileithiya\|Eileithiya]], the kidnapper **Necromancer**, [[Phay Mey (The Mongrel)\|Phay Mey (The Mongrel)]], [[Inquisitor Astraea\|Inquisitor Astraea]], [[Ursula\|Ursula]], and agents of [[About the world/Organisations/The Cause\|The Cause]].
*   **Estranged:** [[About the world/People/Guan Dao\|Guan Dao]] (following the Sansi Civil War).

---

#### Organization

*   **Headquarters:** Primarily mobile, utilizing inns, temporary camps, and occasionally [[Calliope\|Calliope]]'s mansion in [[Sansi\|Sansi]] as a base, particularly after the Civil War.
*   **Leader(s):** Operates without a single designated leader, seemingly relying on collaborative decision-making, though individuals may take initiative based on the situation.
*   **Prominent Members (as of 59 UL):** [[About the world/People/Calliope Vanhoutte\|Calliope Vanhoutte]], [[Peace\|Peace]], [[Einar\|Einar]], [[Alfie\|Alfie]].
*   **Former Members:** [[About the world/People/Guan Dao\|Guan Dao]], [[Dominik Stoch\|Dominik Stoch]], [[Nak\|Nak]], [[Laurentius\|Laurentius]] (deceased).
*   **Associates:** Various individuals have joined for specific missions or periods, including [[About the world/People/Camelia\|Camelia]], [[Shi Yijun\|Shi Yijun]], [[Millie\|Millie]], [[Killian\|Killian]], [[Elro\|Elro]], [[Grunt\|Grunt]].

#### Resources

*   **Funding:** Primarily through **contracts**, **loot** recovered during adventures, and potentially **rewards** from allies like King Catalino I or Benin. Post-Civil War, [[Akasha\|Akasha]] and [[Zassath\|Zassath]] provide some financial support. Calliope's personal wealth may contribute, despite her stated desire for independence.
*   **Equipment:** Possesses standard adventuring gear supplemented by magical items acquired over time, such as Bags of Holding, various potions and scrolls, specific weapons like Calliope's Pan-Dao, and potentially unique artifacts like the lycanthropic tiaras or the Spidersilk Cloak acquired by Nak. They have also purchased transport like carts.
*   **Manpower:** Relies on the skills of its current core members and occasional temporary associates.

---

#### Methods

The Cheese Company employs a variety of methods depending on the task and the members involved:

*   **Investigation:** Gathering information through interviews, scouting, and examining clues (often detailed in Calliope's journals).
*   **Infiltration:** Utilizing stealth, disguise, and bypassing security measures to access restricted areas (Nak was particularly skilled; Calliope has also demonstrated capability).
*   **Direct Combat:** Engaging foes directly using a combination of martial prowess and magical abilities.
*   **Diplomacy & Deception:** Negotiating with allies and enemies, employing persuasion, intimidation, or misdirection as needed.
*   **Chronicle Keeping:** [[Calliope\|Calliope]] meticulously documents the group's activities.

---

#### Cultural Significance

The Cheese Company represents a notable independent adventuring force operating largely outside the direct control of major powers like the [[About the world/Nations/Llerathian Empire\|Llerathian Empire]] or the [[NUL\|NUL]]. Their involvement in the [[About the world/History/Sansi Civil War\|Sansi Civil War]] demonstrates the potential impact such groups can have on regional politics. Their chronicles, primarily through Calliope, offer a valuable, if biased, perspective on events often obscured by official histories.

---
