The **History of the Nations United for Liberty (NUL)** details the political and military evolution of the southern Tinnuithian city-states. Founded in the late 10th century HC as a loose defensive coalition against the Llerathian Empire, the NUL has since developed into a centralized industrial magocracy comprising sixteen federal states. This transformation was driven by the extended Chancellorship of **Liorne Imaeth**, the rapid industrialization of the capital region, and the implementation of emergency powers during the Freedom Wars.

## Formation: The Defensive Alliance (991–995 HC)

The catalyst for the unification of the southern city-states was the **Purge of Himbadihr** in 991 HC (0 UL). Following the consolidation of the Llerathian Empire, imperial forces executed a systematic extermination of the Root Elf and Tiefling populations residing in the Orbital Palace and the deep subterranean networks. Llerathian doctrine justified the purge as a necessary cleansing of residual Abyssal corruption from the Cataclysm. The total destruction of these communities, and the subsequent influx of refugees to the surface, demonstrated to the independent southern states that the Empire’s expansionist policy would not distinguish between neutrality and hostility.

In 992 HC, representatives from four sovereign city-states convened in the Almarosan archipelago. The summit included the industrial hub of **Dhirdam**, the financial center of **Almarosa**, the technocratic state of **Osterrend**, and the druidic enclave of **Chuya**. The result was the ratification of the **Pact for the Preservation of the Arcane Arts**.

This founding document established a mutual defense fund and a customs union to counter Llerathian economic pressure. It did not establish a federal government or a unified military command, as the signatories remained sovereign nations cooperating under a treaty framework.

## The Imaeth Administration and Industrialization (996–998 HC)

The structure of the alliance shifted significantly with the return of **Liorne Imaeth** to Dhirdam in 996 HC. A recognized figure from the pre-Cataclysm era, Imaeth campaigned for the newly created office of Chancellor of the High Council. He advocated for radical modernization to counter the Llerathian threat and secured the position following a decisive electoral victory.

Upon assuming office, Imaeth centralized executive power and appointed two key advisors to his cabinet: **Doctor Mendez** was named Minister of Science, and **Albert Florenza** was appointed Minister of Defense.

The influence of these consultants precipitated the **Dhirdam Miracle**. Beginning in 997 HC, the capital’s foundries implemented advanced technologies previously unknown in the region, including chemical sanitation, assembly-line manufacturing, and early gunpowder ballistics. The resulting economic boom created a marked disparity between the Founding Four and the surrounding independent states.

Between 997 and 998 HC, the NUL expanded from four to ten member states. The alchemical center of **Galrea**, the mining stronghold of **Molheim**, the mathematical academy of **Kruce**, the infrastructure hub of **Coefort**, the trade port of **AlSaib**, and the illusionist city of **Bredapert** all petitioned for integration. These annexations were driven by the need to access proprietary industrial and medical technologies restricted to full member states. The negotiations were managed by the Chancellor's Chief Diplomat, **Akh'zahr Jarrabbi**.

## The First Freedom War and Emergency Powers (999–1029 HC)

The outbreak of the **First Freedom War** in 999 HC provided the political context for the consolidation of federal authority. Following the Llerathian breach of the Criosian border, the High Council enacted the **Emergency Powers Act**. This legislation suspended scheduled elections for the duration of the crisis and granted the Chancellor direct control over the military and internal security apparatus.

To secure the home front, the administration established the **NUL Protection Corps** under the command of **Tristan Rutherford**, a former Llerathian Templar and oathbreaker. Rutherford’s forces were tasked with counter-espionage and the suppression of Llerathian sympathizers within the federation.

Strategic necessities during the war dictated further expansion. Recognizing a vulnerability along the coastline, the NUL moved to integrate the maritime fortress-cities of **Astagion** and **Adriaria**, the atmospheric stronghold of **Vilin**, and the necromantic isles of **Talatos**. The **Half Moon Legion**, a private military company commanded by Minister Florenza, was frequently deployed to these regions to stabilize local governance or repel banditry prior to their formal petition for statehood. By the war’s conclusion, the NUL exercised federal control over the majority of the southern continent.

## Total War and Final Unification (1030–1036 HC)

The **Second Freedom War** (1030 HC), triggered by the excavation of the **Temple of the First Breach**, necessitated total resource mobilization. General Florenza, now Supreme Commander of the NUL Defense Force, deployed mass-produced gunpowder artillery at the **Battle of Tiberang** (1031 HC). This engagement marked the first large-scale use of non-magical kinetic bombardment in continental history.

As the conflict escalated and Llerathian forces scorched the Kingdom of Tevara, the NUL absorbed the final isolationist states. **Bunton** (the Valley of Oracles) and **Shancrani** (the Spire of the Inner Eye) were annexed to secure critical divination and defensive capabilities for the war effort.

During this period, executive decision-making increasingly shifted from the High Council to the **Council of Seven**, a select group of the Chancellor's advisors. This circle included external assets such as **Queen Vivianne Rothtopper** of Criosia, who provided intelligence and necromantic support from the northern border, though Criosia itself remained formally independent of the NUL.

## Post-War Status (1037–Present)

Following the **Treaty of Ash** in 1036 HC, the Emergency Powers Act remained in effect. The government cited the necessity of maintaining readiness during the ensuing Cold Peace. The federal government retained control over the military-industrial complex and internal security.

By 1046 HC, the NUL had established itself as a technocratic superpower of sixteen city-states. Current governance is characterized by the extended tenure of Chancellor Imaeth, the dominance of the military-industrial sector, and the management of internal dissent through both the Protection Corps and the unofficial enforcement of the **Akelarre** syndicate, led by Council member **Lady Demian**.
