The civil war that broke out in Sansi has been one of the bloodiest and most brutal seen in decades. For months, the streets of cities and towns were battlefields, and the skies were darkened by columns of smoke rising from burning buildings.

[[About the world/Organisations/The Cheese Company\|The Cheese Company]] was fighting alongside [[About the world/People/Catalino I, King of Sansi\|King Catalino I]] and his forces, against the supporters of the Barbero, led by [[Matias Barbero\|Matias Barbero]]. The fight was fierce and the adventurers found themselves in the center of the action, fighting for justice and the freedom of the people of [[About the world/Nations/Kingdom of Sansi\|Sansi]]

Despite the courage and determination of the allies, victory seemed distant, until an Orc armada led by a semi-orc commander named [[About the world/People/Guan Dao\|Guan Dao]], the Dominguez faction finally managed to break the power of the Barbero and win the war. The leader of the rebels was killed, thus appeasing the opposition.

The monarch, now undisputed on his throne, offered the orphans adopted by the Company a new definitive home in the royal castle. [[Selene\|Selene]] found happiness there, while [[Michael\|Michael]] continued training to become one of the elite Royal Guards of the king. Meanwhile, Guan Dao and his forces settled in Sencia, a decision that has begun to cause tensions in the region.

The Cheese Company, who had fought alongside Guan Dao before the war, now found themselves in an awkward position, as their former companions had become adversaries. Tensions between them increased when Guan Dao refused to see the Company and instead dedicated himself to consolidating his power and leadership among his own.

Rumors about the return of the Warfas to Votar Tok began to circulate, related to the arrival of an heir of the semi-orc commander. Chu, the veteran orc who had been Guan Dao's right hand, decided to resign from his post and dedicate himself to tending the gardens of Calliope. He never wanted to talk about what happened during the assault on the Barbero Mansion.

Akasha and Zassath settled in Caliope's mansion. Although they maintain a certain distance from the Cheese Company, they help financially and in missions when needed. Zassath has become fond of the beasts of the mansion, even if that costs him arguments with Peace, and Akasha is an expert in cards.

[[About the world/People/Benin Hood Miller\|Lord Hood Miller]] maintained a cordial relationship with the Cheese Company, now being the chief executive of [[Las Tres Chimeneas\|Las Tres Chimeneas]]. His frequent trips for business reasons took him far away, but he always found time to have coffee with Alfie and the other adventurers when he was in Sansi. He was grateful to the Company for their help, as it had allowed him to rebuild his family relationships, frequently inviting them to his lands in Almarrosa.

[[Lubnice\|Lubnice]] has been declared Llerathian territory and both countries are building diplomatic relations. [[Carmen de Sansi\|Carmen de Sansi]] was sent as part of the delegation, led by the Llerathian official in charge of Lubnice, [[About the world/People/Primus Vindicator Lemons\|Primus Lemons]]. This is a mysterious figure, with the reputation of being a paladin of such renown that the Goddess [[About the world/Higher powers/Lux Aeterna\|Lux]] herself allowed him to take a position of power despite his unusual condition.

As for the Cheese Company, there have also been some changes. The master of martial arts, [[About the world/People/Dominik Stoch\|Dominik Stoch]], left the company to follow a clue from his Master that he found in the Barbero mansion. Understanding the risk this could pose to the rest, he decided to leave on his own one night, leaving them a hangover, a loving note and the recipe for his favorite stew.

Meanwhile, the disappearance of the Barbero and the lack of clues about the Tiaras and the cure for lycanthropy left the Cheese Company desperate to find answers. Despite all efforts, they seemed to only follow false leads. Even so, they did not lose hope of finding a solution.

What adventures and challenges await the Cheese Company in the future? Only time will tell.
