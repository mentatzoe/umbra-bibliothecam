Long before the emergence of the abyssal plague that plagued the northern kingdoms, Sansi and Lubnice were two strongly bonded nations by common ties and common royal family. The alliance amongst both nations predated their personal union, driven largely by the great hero, Anniken Bue. 

As the personal council and long time tutor to members of the Lubnice royal family at the time, his influence was critical towards the strengthening of the union. As the unknown disease spread through the lands, Aetsmon, now reborn as Lux Aeterna after her pilgrimage to the Elven pantheon, offered a solution to the peoples of Lubnice. 

The kingdom would be annexed by [[About the world/Nations/Llerathian Empire\|Llerath]] and be granted divine protection from this terrible blight. Their lands and warriors in exchange for survival in the blighted land. The Lubnice branch of the royal family felt the pains of the local people, and to the shock of their brethren in Sansi, accepted. 

There was significant outcry in Sansi, some of the more outspoken members decried the fact that their family in Lubnice had strayed by marrying elves and mixing the bloodline, effectively sowing the seeds that opened the doors to [[About the world/Nations/Llerathian Empire\|Llerath]]. 

The court of Caleborna decided to proclaim Lux Aeterna as persona non grata within the kingdom, damaging any diplomatic relationship the empire and the kingdom may have built in the past. Reprieve from the blight was well received by most in Lubnice, but when the price of salvation was made public to the people in the kingdom, protests erupted. 

The terms were humiliating, a sovereign nation deprived of its pride and natural rights. A small rebellion started, peasants marched the land protesting against the powerless royal family. As the conflict grew, and the peasants armed themselves a compromise was reached. The annexation of Lubnice was reprieved, the kingdom would regain some of its sovereignty and become a protectorate of [[About the world/Nations/Llerathian Empire\|Llerath]]. 

To guarantee Lubnice's independence, an agreement was made where Anniken would sit in Lux Aeterna's council, to ensure the people's voice would be heard within the empire. Little is known about his whereabouts since his departure. 

The people of Sansi and in particular their royal family are still bitter about the loss of the personal union which they perceive as a humiliation. The breaking of family ties is a bitter appetiser to the larger threat looming north, with an invasion of Sansi only being a matter of time. To add insult to injury, some of the events had been foretold by members of the court. The commoners have also felt the humiliation as personal, and as a result have become more aggressive towards elves that have lived in Simpa for generations. 

Rumours of violent pogroms occurring in isolated towns where the King's law is seldom applied are starting to flourish.
