**LCDQ - Sencia/NUL - Void**
## Context

Void first appears in the episode “The tale of Calliope the Brave” in which the Company is trying to escape the ambush in [[Sencia\|Sencia]] (played on 11/07/20) in Major Barbero’s second residence.

Squad and regional lead, responsible for farming slaves of different types for Mendez and Demian.

He’s got a quarterly OKR of providing a certain amount of people, income, or goods.

He’s a tiefling with little to no respect for humans, which makes protecting Barbero especially complicated for him.

Matias is fortunate that as much as he despises humans, he fears Demian more. His specialty is blood magic. Despite being a powerful wizard, Void despises fighting, as he believes that brings the bestiality of his blood, which is more apt for studying. If challenged, he will do everything in his power to avoid open conflict. Character-wise, he’s quite similar to Neera.

He has a small ritual dagger he uses to substitute his components.

## Name

His virtue name is Void, his infernal name Pelaios.

## Location

Void is mostly located in Mayor Barbero’s second residence, near [[Sencia\|Sencia]] and the Barbero mines.

## Profession

He’s a wizard by class, and has been training for a very long time.

## Appearance

Pelaios is 53 years of age, a tall tiefling standing at roughly over 2m.
His hair is the color of flame, eyes an orb of bright gold.

He dresses in traditional southern garments whenever possible, made of simple fabrics. He doesn’t like luxury. On his side he’s got a ceremonial blade, with a carving in infernal that reads “To emptiness we shall return”.

## Attitude

He’s calm, quiet, and rarely raises his voice. Void dislikes combat and fighting, and is a man of scarce words.

*   And how exactly are you going to do that, human?
*   Al’lama!
*   Yalla, yalla, we don’t have all day.

## Backstory

Born and raised in the city-state of Talatos, he moved into [[Dirdam\|Dirdam]] a few years after finishing his education with the intent to become a politician.
As a way to gain more renown in the city, he started working with one of Demian’s gangs. Being a capable wizard he quickly caught Mendez’s interests, who requested him to assist with some of the tasks.
The promise of arcane knowledge and investigation made them closer, which put Void in a position of power within the organisation. For the tiefling, this was a way of gaining some independence from Demian, who had managed to set a contract on him as part of the organisation.
