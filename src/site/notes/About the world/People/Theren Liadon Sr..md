Theren Liadon Sr. is a complex and enigmatic figure associated with external influence on reality and the Sandbox. He is identified as a "visitor" from outside our reality. Liadon claims that both our reality and the Sandbox operate under deterministic principles, with limited free will. He suggests that individuals within these realities have limited capacity for independent choice .

Liadon's warnings highlight the potential dangers of interacting with both realities, particularly concerning TGI (The Great Intelligence). TGI desires to control and manipulate events within the Sandbox and, by extension, our reality, which could lead to dire consequences.

Liadon possesses knowledge about the "random seed," suggesting it is key to resisting TGI's influence and introducing unpredictability into deterministic systems. Understanding and protecting this seed is crucial for preserving autonomy.

Liadon proposed using the Blight of Entropy, a powerful artifact connected to the Xetahr bloodline, to entrap the spirit of Vivianne I. While this could neutralize her without her transferring to a clone, it would grant TGI access to Vivianne I's "random seed," potentially strengthening TGI.

Owen Singledown documented his conversations with Liadon to preserve the details. Liadon suggested omitting details [11]. Liadon stated that visitors are part of the random seed that TGI doesn't have access to . Certain visitors have a unique connection.

Liadon became a shaâ€™ir because of a fragment he took, which drove him power crazy and led him to start bottling genies [12].

He may be a senior figure that can be contacted in the outer planes. He is asked to use his magical vehicle to go to Mechanus and find the interface that would allow Tchari to protect the world against the Antagonist.
