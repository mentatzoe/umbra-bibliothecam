#### Overview

Primus Aegis Keith, formerly designated Hopeful 7313, is a highly skilled elven operative within the [[About the world/Nations/Llerathian Empire\|Llerathian Empire]] and the preeminent figure leading the **Aegis Branch** of **[[About the world/Organisations/Her Enlightened Enquiry\|Her Enlightened Enquiry]]** (HEE), the body responsible for arcane regulation. Raised within the communal Hive system to embody Temple ideals, Keith's path led him through rigorous training culminating in graduation via the Spring Games of 55 UL alongside his squadmate (now Primus Inquisitor) [[Theren Liadon\|Theren Liadon]]. His exceptional combat prowess, elven agility, and fierce loyalty—rooted in the deep devotion to the Goddess [[About the world/Higher powers/Lux Aeterna\|Lux Aeterna]] instilled by his upbringing and tested during the perilous mission to rescue Her—became the direct inspiration for the **Shield** protector role within the reformed HEE. Now bearing the unique title of Primus Aegis and the scars of his service, Keith serves as the personal shield to Llerath's highest-ranking Inquisitor, oversees the standards for all Aegis personnel, and embodies vigilant service to the Light.

---

#### Background

Keith's origins lie within the structured, communal Hive system of Llerath, designed to raise children completely immersed in the teachings of the Light and dedicated to service within the Empire's seven Branches. Known only as 7313 during his formative years, this elf was selected for the rigorous **Hopeful** training program, likely earmarked for duties requiring physical prowess, stealth, and tactical acumen potentially under the purview of the HEE or Temple security forces. Assigned to a squad under Inquisitor [[Bel'Dath\|Bel'Dath]], his training cohort included the magically conscripted Theren Liadon, fellow Hopeful 2841 (Lemons), and the Volunteer known as Gael (Leah Orcisia Malek). The Hive system's intense focus on duty and faith cultivated Keith's profound personal devotion to the Goddess [[About the world/Higher powers/Lux Aeterna\|Lux Aeterna]]. He successfully navigated the demanding trials of the Spring Games in 55 UL, earning the rank of **Initiate** and the right to choose the name "Keith," formally entering Temple service.

---

#### Personality

Keith operates with the sharp adaptability and resourcefulness characteristic of a highly skilled elven operative. His Hive upbringing instilled rigorous discipline and unwavering focus on mission objectives, layered upon the fervent loyalty to Lux expected of Temple initiates. His dedication is palpable, manifesting as intense focus, readiness for action, and a willingness to employ pragmatic, sometimes unconventional methods—including stealth, deception (claiming ambassador status), intimidation, and hypnosis—when necessary to achieve objectives serving the Light. Prominent scars on his right cheek and left eyebrow, along with his shaved head, serve as visible markers of the dangers faced and sacrifices made in his unwavering duty.

While fiercely loyal to Lux and the Empire, this manifests most directly in his absolute dedication to protecting his charge, Primus Inquisitor Theren Liadon. This bond, forged through shared Hopeful trials and solidified by Keith's life-saving actions, is central to his current role. He retains individual traits, including a competitive drive honed during training (seen in duels and games) and social adaptability, capable of employing charm (flirting with servants Erica and Noira) or directness as needed. His core devotion remains the bedrock of his character, often masked by professional competence.
