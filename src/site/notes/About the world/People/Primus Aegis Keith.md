#### Overview

Primus Aegis Keith, formerly designated Hopeful 7313, is a highly skilled elven operative within the [[About the world/Nations/Llerathian Empire\|Llerathian Empire]] and the preeminent figure leading the **Aegis Branch** of **[[About the world/Organisations/Her Enlightened Enquiry\|Her Enlightened Enquiry]]** (HEE), the body responsible for arcane regulation. Raised within the communal Hive system to embody Temple ideals, Keith's path led him through rigorous training culminating in graduation via the Spring Games of 55 UL alongside his squadmate (now Primus Inquisitor) [[Theren Liadon\|Theren Liadon]]. His exceptional combat prowess, elven agility, and fierce loyalty—rooted in the deep devotion to the Goddess [[About the world/Higher powers/Lux Aeterna\|Lux Aeterna]] instilled by his upbringing and tested during the perilous mission to rescue Her—became the direct inspiration for the **Shield** protector role within the reformed HEE. Now bearing the unique title of Primus Aegis and the scars of his service, Keith serves as the personal shield to Llerath's highest-ranking Inquisitor, oversees the standards for all Aegis personnel, and embodies vigilant service to the Light.

---

#### Background

Keith's origins lie within the structured, communal Hive system of Llerath, designed to raise children completely immersed in the teachings of the Light and dedicated to service within the Empire's seven Branches. Known only as 7313 during his formative years, this elf was selected for the rigorous **Hopeful** training program, likely earmarked for duties requiring physical prowess, stealth, and tactical acumen potentially under the purview of the HEE or Temple security forces. Assigned to a squad under Inquisitor [[Bel'Dath\|Bel'Dath]], his training cohort included the magically conscripted Theren Liadon, fellow Hopeful 2841 (Lemons), and the Volunteer known as Gael (Leah Orcisia Malek). The Hive system's intense focus on duty and faith cultivated Keith's profound personal devotion to the Goddess [[About the world/Higher powers/Lux Aeterna\|Lux Aeterna]]. He successfully navigated the demanding trials of the Spring Games in 55 UL, earning the rank of **Initiate** and the right to choose the name "Keith," formally entering Temple service.

---

#### Personality

Keith operates with the sharp adaptability and resourcefulness characteristic of a highly skilled elven operative. His Hive upbringing instilled rigorous discipline and unwavering focus on mission objectives, layered upon the fervent loyalty to Lux expected of Temple initiates. His dedication is palpable, manifesting as intense focus, readiness for action, and a willingness to employ pragmatic, sometimes unconventional methods—including stealth, deception (claiming ambassador status), intimidation, and hypnosis—when necessary to achieve objectives serving the Light. Prominent scars on his right cheek and left eyebrow, along with his shaved head, serve as visible markers of the dangers faced and sacrifices made in his unwavering duty.

While fiercely loyal to Lux and the Empire, this manifests most directly in his absolute dedication to protecting his charge, Primus Inquisitor Theren Liadon. This bond, forged through shared Hopeful trials and solidified by Keith's life-saving actions, is central to his current role. He retains individual traits, including a competitive drive honed during training (seen in duels and games) and social adaptability, capable of employing charm (flirting with servants Erica and Noira) or directness as needed. His core devotion remains the bedrock of his character, often masked by professional competence.

#### Overview

Primus Aegis Keith, formerly designated Hopeful 7313 within the Llerathian Hive system, is a highly skilled elven operative and the foremost exemplar of the **Shield** protector role within the [[About the world/Nations/Llerathian Empire\|Llerathian Empire]]'s Reformed Inquisition. Imbued with the unwavering devotion to the Goddess [[About the world/Higher powers/Lux Aeterna\|Lux Aeterna]] characteristic of Temple initiates, Keith's journey alongside **Primus Inquisitor [[Theren Liadon\|Theren Liadon]]** saw him evolve from a competitive Hopeful into an indispensable protector. His exceptional combat prowess, elven agility, and fierce loyalty—demonstrated most critically during the perilous mission to rescue Lux—became the direct inspiration for the Inquisitor-Shield dynamic. Now holding the unique title of Primus Aegis and bearing the scars of his service, Keith serves as the personal shield to Llerath's highest-ranking Inquisitor, likely overseeing standards for other Shields while embodying vigilant service to the Light through his unwavering protection of Theren.

---

#### Background

Keith's origins lie within the structured, communal Hive system of Llerath, where children are raised collectively, immersed from birth in the teachings of the Light, and trained for service to the Empire. Known only as 7313 during his formative years, this elf was selected for the rigorous **Hopeful** training program under the Inquisition, likely due to aptitudes aligning with physical prowess, stealth, and elven grace. Assigned to a squad under Inquisitor [[Bel'Dath\|Bel'Dath]], his training cohort included Theren Liadon (now Primus Inquisitor), Hopeful 2841 (now Primus Lemons), and the Volunteer known as Gael (Leah Orcisia Malek). The Hive system's focus on duty and faith cultivated Keith's profound personal devotion to the Goddess Lux Aeterna. He successfully completed the demanding trials of the Spring Games in 55 UL, earning the rank of **Initiate** and selecting the name "Keith."

---

#### Personality

Keith operates with the sharp adaptability and resourcefulness characteristic of a highly skilled elven operative, augmented by inherent quickness. His Hive upbringing instilled rigorous discipline and mission focus, layered upon the unwavering loyalty rooted in the profound devotion to Lux cultivated since childhood. His dedication is palpable, often manifesting as intense focus and readiness for action. Prominent scars marking his right cheek and bisecting his left eyebrow serve as constant, visible reminders of the dangers inherent in his duty and the price he has paid protecting his charge. His head is kept shaved, a stark contrast to typical elven styles, adopted perhaps for practicality or as a symbol of absolute focus following a severe incident in the line of duty.

He is pragmatic, readily employing stealth, deception (successfully bluffing guards by claiming ambassadorial status), intimidation, opportune recovery of useful gear, and even unconventional tactics like hypnosis when deemed necessary to serve the greater goal – protecting Lux and her interests, primarily manifested through safeguarding Primus Inquisitor Theren Liadon. This loyalty, forged through shared trials, is his defining characteristic.

While intensely loyal, he retains individual traits, including a competitive streak from his Hopeful days (seen in duels and games) and the initiative to act independently based on his assessment of a situation. He is socially adaptable, capable of employing charm (flirting with servants Erica and Noira) or directness as needed. His core devotion to Lux may remain a private intensity, masked by outward competence and unwavering focus on his duty as Shield.
