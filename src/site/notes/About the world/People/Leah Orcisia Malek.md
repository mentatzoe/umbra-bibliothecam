#### Overview

Leah Orcisia Malek is the sole known surviving heir of the noble Orcisia family, a line historically significant within the [[About the world/Nations/Llerathian Empire\|Llerathian Empire]] before facing tragedy. Forced into the Temple system as a **Volunteer** under the male alias **Gael** due to past circumstances (potentially linked to a period of captivity and mysterious tattoos), she trained alongside Hopefuls [[Theren Liadon \| Theren]], [[About the world/People/Primus Aegis Keith\|Keith]] (7313), and Lemons (2841) under Inquisitor [[Bel'Dath\|Bel'Dath]]. As Gael, she proved to be a capable if sometimes volatile operative. After revealing her true identity, she participated in the harrowing mission to rescue the abducted Goddess [[About the world/Higher powers/Lux Aeterna\|Lux Aeterna]]. Briefly regaining her family lands as recompense, Leah disappeared without a trace shortly thereafter, leaving her ultimate fate and allegiances uncertain.

#### Background

Leah is the younger child of Lord Count Duke Angus Orcisia and Liara Malek of the Hawking province. Her elder brother, Lyle, forfeited his inheritance rights upon becoming a Templar, positioning Leah as the heir. Her backstory file mentions a traumatic period involving capture and the application of tattoos potentially granting some form of illusionary ability, possibly linked to her later adoption of the "Gael" persona. The specific events leading to her designation as a **Volunteer**—a status reserved for criminals or heretics offered service in lieu of harsher punishment—remain unclear but likely tie into this troubled past or actions taken afterward.

As "Gael," she was assigned to Bel'Dath's training squad. During this time (53-55 UL), she operated entirely under her male alias, participating in numerous demanding missions designed to prepare the Hopefuls for the Spring Games and service to the Temple. The Orcisia family itself had historical ties to Lux and prominent figures within Llerath, though these connections were obscured by tragedy and Leah's Volunteer status. Her parents met during wartime, and her family was exiled to the North at some point before the central narrative begins.

#### Personality

Leah's personality is marked by a significant duality stemming from her time operating as Gael.

*   **As Gael:** She presented as a pragmatic, competent, and sometimes confrontational individual. Gael was resourceful in investigations, capable in combat, and engaged directly with squadmates, including notable friction and later camaraderie with Keith. This persona was also marked by vulnerabilities: recurring fainting spells often accompanied by a strange glowing phenomenon, and a documented instance of a "third eye" revealing hidden truths. Gael could be impulsive and fiercely protective, sometimes exhibiting near-frenzied aggression in combat (as seen against cultists).
*   **As Leah:** After revealing her identity (around 55 UL), Leah displayed the weight of her past. While retaining her core competence and intelligence, she exhibited signs of significant trauma, including severe anxiety attacks triggered by intimacy or stressful memories (particularly concerning her parents and the entity Arru). She demonstrated determination in pursuing personal leads (seeking Mark, investigating her family's history) and a capacity for complex emotional connection, though often laced with apprehension.

Across both identities, Leah is fundamentally resilient, adaptable, and fiercely protective of those she forms bonds with. She carries deep secrets related to her past captivity, her family's downfall, potentially problematic pacts or patrons ("Leah says her patron left with the Goddess... making deals with an entity"), and the strange afflictions she suffers. Her loyalty developed towards her squadmates, particularly Theren, navigating complex dynamics shaped by deception and shared trauma.

#### Abilities and Skills

*   **Combat Proficiency:** Demonstrated skill in physical combat during numerous training missions and the Spring Games, capable of holding her own against various opponents, including Keith in duels (though she ultimately lost) and hostile creatures/cultists. Showed interest in archery, seeking instruction.
*   **Mastery of Disguise:** Successfully maintained the male "Gael" identity for an extended period, implying significant skill in altering appearance, mannerisms, and voice. This may have been aided by her tattoos or inherent abilities.
*   **Investigation & Perception:** Proved adept at investigation, spotting crucial details (suspicious chest at the Baths, box in the Society basement), finding hidden information, and pursuing leads independently. Her "third eye" incident suggests potentially unique perceptive abilities under specific circumstances.
*   **Supernatural Afflictions/Connections:** Suffers from unexplained fainting spells accompanied by glowing. Possesses a connection to at least one external entity ("patron") and possibly the entity Arru, linked to her family's past. Experienced visions (e.g., seeing through the eyes of a fleeing suspect).
*   **Resilience:** Endured significant physical and psychological hardship, including captivity, intense training, combat, planar travel, and confronting deep personal trauma.
