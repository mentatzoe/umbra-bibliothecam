**Honorary Title**: King of Sansi

## Early Life

**Catalino I** was born in Caleborna in 1033, the only son of **Esteban IV** and **Helena Mulinterno**. He spent most of his childhood in the coastal town of **Ribarrossa**, known for its distinctive red sandy shores. The young prince was home-schooled, with his education overseen by his mother and a team of scholars appointed by the Court.

His interests as a child included horse-riding, jousting, and dueling, activities common among boys his age. Alongside these pastimes, his formal education focused on preparing him for the complex world of court politics. His studies included foreign cultures and philosophy, the latter encouraged by his mother, who had a deep passion for the works of ancient philosophers.
## Rise to the Throne

Catalino inherited the title of **King of [[About the world/Nations/Kingdom of Sansi\|Sansi]]** at the age of 10 following the prolonged illness of his father, **Esteban IV**. His name was chosen by his father as a symbolic gesture, intended to link his destiny to that of **Katherina Vita Dalgaard**, the last Lubnician monarch of Sansi before the excision. Esteban IV believed that Catalino would be the ruler to reunite Sansi once more.

The family returned to the royal residence in Caleborna following the news of the king’s illness. Though still a child, Catalino was being prepared for the inevitable responsibility of kingship.
## Imprisonment of Queen Mother Helena

**Helena Mulinterno** sought to provide her son with a broad, multicultural perspective, often incorporating philosophies from other cultures into his education. However, her influence and the discovery of **[[About the world/Lore/Llerathian Scriptures\|Llerathian Scriptures]]** among her possessions raised suspicion among the court.

In 1042, as anti-Llerathian sentiment swelled following the **Battle of Aquilino's Death**, Helena was imprisoned. Catalino, still young and without authority, was unable to prevent the court’s actions. His father was too weak to intervene, and the court remained steadfast in their decision.

Servants noted that after these events, the once optimistic boy from [[Ribarrossa\|Ribarrossa]] was never the same.
