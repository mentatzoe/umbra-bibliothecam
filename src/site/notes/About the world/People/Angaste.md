#### Overview

Angaste is a young Root Elf/Drow, a survivor of the catastrophic attack on the "Orbital Palace," an underground settlement of her people. Rescued during the ensuing chaos by the Tiefling noble [[About the world/People/Lady Demian\|Raphaelle (later Lady Demian)]], Angaste has since been under her protection. Despite her youth at the time of the attack, she displayed remarkable toughness and an early understanding of survival, rooted in the rites of her people. She is a priestess of Rachna, a deity central to Drow faith, and has trained [[LiNeerafae\|LiNeerafae]], a surface-born Drow, in the ways of their people. Her experiences have instilled in her a deep loyalty to Lady Demian, seeing her as a kind protector despite her imposing appearance.

#### Background

Angaste's early life was within the "Orbital Palace," a significant underground settlement likely identifiable as [[Himbadihr\|Himbadihr]], a known bastion of Drow civilization and worship of the goddess Rachna. She was a young priestess, no more than 10 or 11 years old, when her home was violently attacked by forces proclaiming to "purge in the name of the Light," likely Llerathian templars or similarly aligned paladins. During this devastating event, which saw the collapse of structures and widespread slaughter, Angaste was found and taken under the protection of [[Raphaelle "Elle" Demian\|Raphaelle]], a Tiefling noble also fleeing the destruction.

Despite her young age, Angaste's upbringing as a Root Elf had instilled in her a degree of resilience and understanding of crisis survival; it is noted that "fights to death werenâ€™t uncommon as root elvish rites of passing." She possessed an ornate dagger, given to her by Raphaelle, and knew how to use it. Together, they navigated the besieged city, witnessing atrocities before a final confrontation led to Raphaelle's injury and their subsequent rescue or discovery by agents of [[Lord Imaeth\|Lord Imaeth]]. Following this, Angaste remained with Raphaelle as she became Lady Demian.

Later, Angaste is known to have trained [[LiNeerafae\|LiNeerafae]], a surface-born Drow, suggesting she continued to uphold and pass on the traditions and skills of her people even after the loss of her home. This also indicates she survived and matured under Lady Demian's care.

#### Personality

As a child, Angaste, though sad and frightened by the attack on her home, possessed a "toughness unusual in a child."
