#### Overview

Inquisitor Theren Liadon is a prominent elven practitioner of illusionary arts, originating from the Lubnician nobility but now a key figure within the [[About the world/Nations/Llerathian Empire\|Llerathian Empire]]. Recognized for his sharp intellect and resourceful nature, Theren was tempered by perilous investigations, political intrigue, and harrowing journeys across planes of existence during the NUL invasion of 58 UL. He was instrumental in the subsequent reforms within Llerath, conceptualizing the protective Inquisitor-Shield dynamic and founding new institutions for the controlled study of various arcane disciplines. Driven by a commitment to protect the Empire and uncover truths about his complex family history, he works closely with his designated protector, Keith (7313).

#### Background

Born to the Liadon family of the [[Protectorate of Lubnice\|Protectorate of Lubnice]] (formally annexed by Llerath in 58 UL), Theren's upbringing straddled the cultural influences of his homeland and the powerful neighboring Empire. His father is identified as **[[About the world/People/Theren Liadon Sr.\|Theren Liadon Sr.]]**, an enigmatic figure known as a 'Visitor' with deep knowledge of planar travel, Sha'ir (elemental) magic, and potentially the fundamental nature of reality itself. Despite his noble status, Theren holds a personal philosophy of equality ("Even being noble, we all have the same blood, I am not above others").

His family history is complex, involving connections to music, ancient servant lines, and his father's esoteric pursuits. Theren recalls childhood friction with his elder sister regarding his own innate magical talent, which she viewed negatively. This likely fostered his strong drive for self-reliance ("I can take care of myself without my family"). In recent years, his sister assumed leadership of the family under unclear circumstances following a reported "accident," prompting Theren's ongoing investigation. He received early guidance within the Llerathian Inquisition under [[Bel'Dath\|Bel'Dath]], quickly showing aptitude for inquiry and illusion. His actions and words, sometimes deviating from strict noble or Llerathian norms, have reportedly caused embarrassment for his family in the past, reflecting this internal tension.

---
#### Personality

Theren possesses a fundamentally ethical worldview, generally aiming to aid others and uncover truth, balanced with a pragmatic and often subtle approach. He is highly intelligent, observant, and studious. The traumatic events of 58 UL -the NUL invasion, the abduction and rescue of [[About the world/Higher powers/Lux Aeterna\|Lux Aeterna]], the loss of his mentor [[Bel'Dath\|Bel'Dath]], and near-death experiences- have instilled in him deep resilience and a serious demeanour.

He exhibits fierce loyalty to trusted companions, especially his Shield, Keith, whose actions forged a profound bond between them. Theren likely carries a degree of world-weariness but also operates with increased gravitas, having witnessed the vulnerability of divine power and the fragility of cosmic order. His focus is now firmly on strengthening Llerath through controlled magical advancement and countering external threats. While inherently curious, his suspicions are sharply honed, particularly regarding manipulation and hidden agendas. He is respected within the reformed Llerathian structure and carries his significant responsibilities with diligence, though the common folk reportedly view him as something of a local hero.
