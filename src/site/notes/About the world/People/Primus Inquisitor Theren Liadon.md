#### Overview

Primus Inquisitor Theren Liadon is a prominent elven practitioner of illusionary arts, originating from the Lubnician nobility but now a key figure within the [[About the world/Nations/Llerathian Empire\|Llerathian Empire]]. Recognized for his sharp intellect and resourceful nature, Theren was conscripted into Temple service due to his magical aptitude. He rose from the rank of **Hopeful** through rigorous training missions, culminating in victory at the Spring Games of 55 UL. Tempered by the subsequent NUL invasion and a harrowing mission across planes to rescue the abducted Goddess [[About the world/Higher powers/Lux Aeterna\|Lux Aeterna]], he became a key architect of arcane reform within the Empire. He conceptualized the protective Inquisitor-Shield dynamic and founded new institutions for the controlled study of diverse magical arts. Driven by a commitment to protect the Empire and uncover truths about his complex family history, he works closely with his designated protector, **Initiate Keith**.

---
#### Background

Born to the Liadon family of the [[Protectorate of Lubnice\|Protectorate of Lubnice]] (formally annexed by Llerath in 58 UL), Theren's early life was marked by the discovery of his innate magical talent, when he recalls childhood friction with his elder sister regarding his magic.

As Llerathian doctrine mandates strict supervision of all mages by the Branch of Illumination, his family conscripted him into the Temple system as a **Hopeful**. He received initial guidance within the Llerathian Inquisition under Inquisitor [[Bel'Dath\|Bel'Dath]], training alongside other Hopefuls and assigned Volunteers. 

In 56-57 UL, his sister assumed leadership of the family under unclear circumstances following a reported "accident," prompting Theren's ongoing investigation. 

In this investigation, Theren discovered that his father, an absent figure during his childhood, was no other than the homonimous **[[About the world/People/Theren Liadon Sr.\|Theren Liadon Sr.]]**, a historical enigmatic figure associated with extensive planar travel and a rare, deep connection to elemental forces: a tradition sometimes involving forming pacts or understandings with elemental spirits or genies. 

The Liadon family history includes connections to music, ancient servant lines, and his father's esoteric knowledge. Despite his noble status, Theren has always held a philosophy of equality, which has likely been influenced by his conscription.

---
#### Personality

Theren possesses a fundamentally ethical worldview, generally aiming to aid others and uncover truth, balanced with a pragmatic and often subtle approach. He possesses a sharp, analytical mind, honed through rigorous Temple training and complex field missions. 

Even as a **Hopeful**, he demonstrated a methodical approach to investigation, meticulously examining clues and preferring subtle solutions like crafted illusionary devices or sleep gas over direct confrontation. His deep-seated belief in equality, sometimes created friction with his noble background and traditional Llerathian hierarchies. He can be studious to the point of near-obsession, diving deep into esoteric texts or mission details.

The harrowing events surrounding the NUL invasion and the subsequent rescue mission forged a deep resilience and gravitas in him, though likely leaving him with a degree of world-weariness. He exhibits fierce, unwavering loyalty to his trusted companions, most notably his Shield, **[[Keith\|Keith]]**, with whom he shares a profound bond built through shared trials and life-saving interventions. His relationship with **[[Primus Lemons\|Primus Lemons]]** (formerly 2841) is one of camaraderie and reliable partnership, stemming from their shared experiences as Hopefuls and during critical missions. His history with **[[Gael/Leah\|Gael/Leah]]** is complex, marked by shared danger, periods of closeness, and ultimately, unresolved questions following her disappearance.

While generally composed and strategically minded, Theren is capable of nuanced emotional responses. He has shown compassion (notably comforting Leah during moments of distress), awkwardness in social situations, and flashes of jealousy concerning relationships. Encounters with manipulative individuals and hidden agendas have cultivated a sharp skepticism within him; he possesses a deep-seated mistrust of those who employ deceit or coercion to achieve their ends. 

Despite the weight of his responsibilities and the secrets he carries, Theren remains dedicated to the service of the Light, helping others, and the pursuit of truth. Even if he might have a degree of learned social awkwardness, he makes a point to stay approachable despite his station, ensuring that the common folk don't perceive him as an aloof hero.
