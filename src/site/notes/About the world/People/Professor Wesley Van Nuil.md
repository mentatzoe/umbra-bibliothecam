STGM - [[MUD\|MUD]], [[Criosia\|Criosia]]

## Context
The character first appears in the game “Return to the [[MUD\|MUD]]”, being one of the assistants to [[Head Professor Evers\|Head Professor Evers]]. He originally sealed the powers within [[Lily\|Lily]] by adding a sigil/rune to her hand, which he removed after being requested and proved that she was able to control herself.

He gave her a bracelet that contained a sending stone which connected him to her.

## Secrets
There are some open questions as to how the recent events in the Season Finale unraveled. Is Wesley Van Nuil a mole from “The Cause” who stays at the university, or was he always [[Lenore\|Lenore]] in disguise? It wouldn't make sense for someone to travel so far, so fast, unless she was using magic. It would also be harder to justify that he wasn't at the university for the period of time that Lenore was up the fields (unless she was using teleportation magic -which she could have).

I think that the right way to look into this is to consider what offers the most interesting narrative options moving forward:
* If it was always Lenore
    * Since she can teleport, she should be able to have a way back
    * If she flees, there's a new BBEG for the campaign: but there's already Varcolac and Amin Steelbane
* I would need to explain how she was able to cast that sigil on the hand considering that she's an artificer
    * What's that spell even? Is it related to the seal of control that the NUL uses?
* If they kill Christopher, it could give her a reason to grow stronger in the future (considering he was a mentor)
* If Van Nuil was a mole
    * They have now discovered that the cause has ties with the University, giving another plot point
    * The players may be suspicious of the university altogether
    * There's a chance that Lenore will die and therefore not be there anymore
    * She could still teleport out or flee
    * This could also explain why the spells were seemingly different
    * There's now a new enemy for the party, but he won't be an open enemy
    * Why wouldn't he just try to have them expelled?
    * Maybe he will try, and they will have a deadline to prove, and a council to go against, and who knows what
