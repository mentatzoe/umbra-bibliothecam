#### Overview

**Dominik Stoch** is a highly skilled human martial artist, best known for his time as a **founding member of [[About the world/Organisations/The Cheese Company\|The Cheese Company]]** (55 UL). Originally an apprentice at the [[Ciraya Monastery\|Ciraya Monastery]] under the tutelage of the monk [[Kemit Enoch\|Kemit Enoch]], he possessed a notably kind heart and dedication, described by his mentor as having the "spirit of youth." He joined [[About the world/People/Calliope Vanhoutte\|Calliope]] and [[About the world/People/Guan Dao\|Guan Dao]] to form the adventuring company, contributing significantly to their exploits, including the rescue of [[About the world/People/Calliope Vanhoutte\|Calliope]] from death (c. 56 UL) and navigating the dangers of the [[About the world/History/Sansi Civil War\|Sansi Civil War]] (c. 56-58 UL). His path took a sharp turn following the devastating revelation that his esteemed Master, [[Phay Mey (The Mongrel)\|Phay Mey]], was the treacherous figure known as The Mongrel, responsible for horrific experiments. Compounded by the loss of his mentor Kemit during the conflicts near [[Burr Hollow\|Burr Hollow]], Dominik left The Cheese Company (c. 58 UL) to pursue a solitary quest, seemingly driven by the weight of betrayal and the legacy left by Kemit.

#### Background

Dominik's formative years were spent at the **[[Ciraya Monastery\|Ciraya Monastery]]**, training as an apprentice (Novitiate) under [[Kemit Enoch\|Kemit Enoch]] in the ways of their martial and philosophical order, known as the Path. Early monastery records might speak of a youth with wide brown eyes and golden hair, but upon joining [[About the world/Organisations/The Cheese Company\|The Cheese Company]] in 55 UL, he was known for his **shaved head**. During his apprenticeship, he accompanied Kemit on missions, including a notable instance near [[Burr Hollow\|Burr Hollow]] where they rescued the dryad [[Olea\|Olea]] from bullywugs and a grey-skinned shaman, learning the hard lesson that not everyone can be saved.

His mentor, Kemit, eventually left the monastery, continuing his journey and chronicling his experiences in a manuscript. These letters, later received by Dominik, detailed Kemit's efforts to protect Burr Hollow, his philosophical struggles, his eventual confrontation with an Astagioni squad, and his death fighting for his beliefs (c. 55 UL). Kemit entrusted Dominik with delivering this manuscript to [[Lord Tjesh Enoch\|Lord Tjesh Enoch]] in [[Druiminn\|Druiminn]]. Dominik's other significant figure, Master [[Phay Mey (The Mongrel)\|Phay Mey]], would later be revealed as The Mongrel, orchestrating atrocities from a hidden manor.

#### Personality

Dominik is depicted as **kind-hearted**, **energetic**, and **deeply dedicated**. His mentor, Kemit, saw in him the "spirit of youth." Despite the hardships faced, including the death of his mentor and the profound betrayal by his Master, he maintains a strong moral compass and a sense of duty. He is capable of great focus and resolve in combat and investigation. His departure from The Cheese Company, leaving behind a "loving note and the recipe for his favorite stew," suggests a considerate nature, even amidst personal turmoil. His background includes time spent as a hermit, suggesting a capacity for introspection and self-reliance, now likely intensified by his solitary quest driven by loss and betrayal.

#### Appearance

Dominik is a human of **medium build**. When he joined [[About the world/Organisations/The Cheese Company\|The Cheese Company]], he was noted for his **shaved head**, a contrast perhaps to descriptions from his younger monastery days.
