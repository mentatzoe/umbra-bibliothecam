She first appeared in “Return to the MUD”, when [[The Naturals\|The Naturals]] teleported back into the University after the battle of Luggermourne. After interrogating them to understand their relationship with Murgus, and revealing who Murgus actually was ([[About the world/People/Amin Steelbane\|Amin Steelbane]]), she vouched for them and let them continue with their university journey.
