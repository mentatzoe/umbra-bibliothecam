#### Overview

**Calliope Vanhoutte** is a prominent and often dramatic founding member of [[About the world/Organisations/The Cheese Company\|The Cheese Company]], an adventuring group operating primarily in [[Sansi\|Sansi]] and surrounding regions. Born into the influential Vanhoutte nobility of [[Lubnice\|Lubnice]], she eschewed a life of social protocols for the unpredictable path of an adventurer, driven by a desire for independence. Known for her **sharp wit**, **artistic magical talents**, and **resilient spirit**, Calliope serves as the **primary chronicler** for her companions, detailing their exploits, often with a humorous or sarcastic tone, in a series of personal journals. Despite facing numerous dangers, including a documented instance of **death** (c. 56 UL) and subsequent rescue, she continues to navigate complex political landscapes, magical threats, and personal afflictions with notable pragmatism and courage. The period of the [[Campaigns/LCDQ/The Visitor Trials\|The Visitor Trials]] and the culmination of events at [[Ursula\|Ursula]]'s lab (59 UL) represent the **most recent documented events** of her journey.

#### Background

Calliope was born into the wealthy and influential Vanhoutte family in [[Lubnice\|Lubnice]], a territory known for its wine production and later annexed by the [[About the world/Nations/Llerathian Empire\|Llerathian Empire]] (58 UL). 

As the third child of Arnstein and Julfrid Vanhoutte, she grew up surrounded by wealth and social protocols, attending private schools and dedicating much of her free time to structured activities like horse riding, language lessons, music, and ballroom dance. She found this strict environment stifling, feeling she had few real friends and disliking the planned future laid out for her by her parents. 

This sparked her desire for adventure and a life beyond Lubnice, seeking to prove herself **independently of her family's status**, though she still values her family's approval and is mindful of their reputation. Her father, Arnstein, is the strict Head of the family's wine business, known for his connections and suspected shady dealings. Her mother, Julfrid, from the wealthy Finstad family (involved in politics), is also strict but perhaps more emotionally accessible. Her older brothers, Erlend and Eirik, are involved in the family business. 

Calliope's current residence is uncertain, fitting her adventurous lifestyle. She was a **founding member of [[About the world/Organisations/The Cheese Company\|The Cheese Company]] in 55 UL**, alongside [[About the world/People/Guan Dao\|Guan Dao]] and [[Dominic\|Dominic]], who have since left the group.

#### Personality

Calliope's personality is vividly captured in her personal journals. She possesses a **keen wit** and a **penchant for dramatic narration**, frequently employing humor and sarcasm even in the face of danger. She appears **observant** and **analytical**, often reflecting on the strange circumstances and individuals encountered. 

Despite her sometimes flippant tone, she demonstrates a deep-seated **resilience** and **pragmatism**. Calliope values **loyalty** and **friendship**, standing by her companions through perilous missions. She is also known to be **competitive** and can exhibit **irritation** when frustrated. She maintains some habits from her wealthy upbringing, such as a notable care for her appearance, and she has expressive eyebrows. A peculiar trait is her tendency to ask **awkward questions** to creatures she hasn't encountered before. 

Her sign-offs, such as "Yours dramatically" or "Always with a smile under the helm," underscore her distinct, theatrical personal brand. She excels in captivating others, making them feel like the most important person in the world. She strives for **independence** and must prove she can handle herself without family coddling, yet faces challenges with the approval of her family. By her own words and actions, she often brings shame to her family. She values freedom and individuality over strict rules or purely altruistic ideals.
