#### Overview

**Guan Dao** is a formidable **Half-Orc Warchief**, known for his tactical prowess and combat skill with a glaive. Originating from the harsh buffer zone between [[Criosia\|Criosia]] and [[About the world/Nations/Confederation of Votar Tok\|Confederation of Votar Tok]], he rose through the ranks of roaming Warfas before becoming a **founding member of [[About the world/Organisations/The Cheese Company\|The Cheese Company]]** in 55 UL. He played a pivotal role in the recent [[About the world/History/Sansi Civil War\|Sansi Civil War]] (c. 56-58 UL), leading an Orc armada that decisively shifted the conflict in favor of [[About the world/People/Catalino I, King of Sansi\|King Catalino I]]. Following the war, Guan Dao and his forces settled in [[Sencia\|Sencia]], where he focused on consolidating his power, leading to strained relations with his former companions in The Cheese Company, effectively ending his active membership. He is known for his pragmatic, direct approach and for acquiring literacy later in life.

#### Background

Guan Dao's origins are rooted in the inhospitable lands between [[Criosia\|Criosia]] and [[About the world/Nations/Confederation of Votar Tok\|Confederation of Votar Tok]], a buffer zone marked by scarred earth and warring bands. As a **Half-Orc**, he does not remember his precise origins and cares little for them, having been pressed into a roaming gang at a young age. He was often mocked for his "soft features" in these harsh lands. He learned to fight within a mixed **Warfa** of over a hundred warriors, receiving tactical instruction from **Tsao Meng**, the warchief, and training in the glaive from **Han Liu**, the champion of the vanguard.

This Warfa was fractured when Tsao Meng killed Han Liu to consolidate power. Although Tsao Meng was seemingly mortally wounded and left behind, Guan Dao was angered by Han Liu's death and abandoned Tsao Meng, an act he later secretly regretted.

Guan Dao traveled through [[Criosia\|Criosia]], working as a mercenary and selling his services to those who valued an Orcish warrior. His travels led him to the turbulent town of Stilts of [[Maraga\|Maraga]] (c. 53 UL), a hub for those of ill repute. While there, he overheard **Zhang Fao**, a warrior subordinate to Tsao Meng, discussing plans to establish a new Warfa near [[Maraga\|Maraga]]'s Gate for a future operation directed by Tsao Meng. Motivated by a mix of regret and strategic interest, Guan Dao followed Zhang Fao's group for weeks (c. 53-54 UL).

His path eventually intersected with [[Calliope\|Calliope]] and [[Dominic\|Dominic]], and together they **founded [[About the world/Organisations/The Cheese Company\|The Cheese Company]] in 55 UL**.

During the [[About the world/History/Sansi Civil War\|Sansi Civil War]] (c. 56-58 UL), Guan Dao led an Orc armada to support the Dominguez faction under [[About the world/People/Catalino I, King of Sansi\|King Catalino I]] against the Barbero. His arrival proved decisive, breaking the Barbero's power and securing victory for the King. Following the war, Guan Dao and his forces settled in Sencia, a decision that has caused some tensions in the region.

#### Personality

Guan Dao is characterized by his pragmatism and directness. Hardened by his upbringing in the buffer zones and refined by Tsao Meng's teachings, he values tactics, strength, and efficiency. 

While initially loyal to his companions in The Cheese Company, his focus shifted after the Sansi Civil War towards consolidating his power and leadership over his Orc forces in Sencia. 

His journals reveal a dry, sometimes sarcastic humor, often underscoring the absurdity of the situations he encounters. He has a notable social awkwardnes, feeling uncomfortable in large crowds or being surrounded by people. Despite this, he can present himself professionally when necessary. He seems to prioritize action and strategic execution over lengthy discussions. 

His later-acquired ability to read and write suggests a dedication to personal improvement and knowledge. Following the Civil War, he reportedly refused to see his former Cheese Company companions, indicating a potential shift in alliances or priorities.
