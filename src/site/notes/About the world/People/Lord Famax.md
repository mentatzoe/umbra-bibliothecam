**Lord Famax** was a beholder born of unknown origins.

*   **Actions:** Manipulated people of Simpa to rebel against [[Nagish\|Nagish]] (Three Chimneys kingpin). Led rebellion from abandoned castle in northern [[Tevara\|Tevara]]. Infiltrated and disrupted the [[Three Chimneys\|Three Chimneys]].

## Delegating Problems

*   **Nagish's Task:** Nagish tasked lieutenant Benin Hood Miller to find Famax's location.
*   **Benin's Discovery:** Quickly located Famax's fiend location: hidden smuggling location fortified by Nagish loyalists and kobolds, silent shipments to Simpa via canals (draining Three Chimneys funds).
*   **Benin's Dilemma:** Benin's men unable to fight Famax, revealing monster to Simpa allies risky (Three Chimneys weakness exposed).
*   **Cheese Company Contract:** Benin heard of Cheese Company surviving [[Llerath\|Llerath]] patrols/Inquisitor attack. Hired them in Comapla (western [[Sansi\|Sansi]]).

## Explosive Opportunities

*   **Gunpowder Delivery:** Benin hired Cheese Company to deliver gunpowder to Famax's mountain hideout, assuming infiltration capability.
*   **Contract Details:** Cheese Company agreed to deliver unspecified goods to northern [[Tevara\|Tevara]] (lesser sum than Benin expected), escorted gunpowder across Simpa.
*   **Second Reward:** Benin offered second reward to eliminate Famax at Beholder's Peak (key smuggling location).
*   **Company's Success:** Cheese Company accepted, butchered through jungle/mountains, eliminated Famax's troops (sycophants/mercenaries).
*   **Famax Encounter:** Explored four castle floors, encountered Famax. Laurentius and Caliope captured (Laurentius first contact). Famax aware of artifact, requested it for bargain.
*   **Final Assault:** Company rescued warriors, planned assault, charged into lair, Famax ambush. Laurentius sacrificed self (gunpowder barrels in bag of holding). Guan Dao ignited barrels (Peace's flame), Calliope's tiny hut. Famax caught in explosion, shot up chimney. Mountain trembled.
*   **Split Company:** Company escaped, split in half: some through mountain top, rest ambushed by surviving Famax.

## Rescue Party

*   Half company returned. Worried Benin accompanied rescue attempt.
