#### Overview

Cyran Leowenis is an elven agent affiliated with the [[About the world/Nations/Llerathian Empire\|Llerathian Empire]]'s intelligence branch, the Beehive, and hails from the Llerathian [[House Godric\|House Godric]]. Operating under the guise of an independent druid in the vicinity of the NUL city-state of [[About the world/Nations/Osterrend\|Osterrend]], Cyran engages in covert activities, including monitoring local events, recruiting assets, and potentially orchestrating operations aligned with Llerathian interests. He is known for his meticulous nature, resourcefulness, and use of truth-compelling magic to verify information. He is the brother of [[About the world/People/Brother Ash\|Brother Ash]].

---

#### Background

Cyran Leowenis belongs to [[House Godric\|House Godric]], an elven noble family within the [[About the world/Nations/Llerathian Empire\|Llerathian Empire]]. Like his brother, [[About the world/People/Brother Ash\|Brother Ash]], Cyran seemingly dedicated himself to the service of the Empire, joining the ranks of the Beehive, Llerath's intelligence service. At some point prior to 59 UL, he established an operational presence near [[About the world/Nations/Osterrend\|Osterrend]], a major city within the rival [[NUL\|NUL]].

To maintain cover in this potentially hostile territory, Cyran adopted the persona of an independent Elven Druid. He publicly claims origins from **Ylma Thalore**, a location described as northeast of [[Eldengroth\|Eldengroth]] – notably, a region whose Old Elves are known to have distanced themselves from Llerath, making this a plausible origin story to mask his true Imperial allegiance. His activities suggest a long-term assignment focused on gathering intelligence and influencing events within or near Osterrend.

---

#### Personality

Cyran presents as a concerned and knowledgeable druid, demonstrating awareness of local issues like the plague affecting Osterrend's outskirts. However, this persona masks a calculated and mission-focused operative. His use of enchantments compelling truthful speech during briefings indicates a methodical approach and a need for verifying the loyalty and honesty of assets or collaborators. Keen observers have noted that he seems to be concealing ulterior motives during interactions related to his "druidic" missions. He appears resourceful, capable of setting up secure meeting locations (his hut) and initiating contact with adventuring groups when needed for specific tasks. An encounter with an owl addressing someone as "compañero" (comrade) might hint at his use of animal forms or messengers.

---

#### Abilities and Skills

*   **Druidic Magic (Persona):** Cyran capably projects the image of a skilled druid. His mission concerning the plague cure involved specific knowledge of rare algae (Calen Redhi) and their potential properties, suggesting a working understanding of natural remedies and ecology. He likely possesses abilities related to nature communion or healing suitable for maintaining his cover.
*   **Truth-Compelling Enchantments:** Known to employ magic that compels truthful speech during sensitive briefings, ensuring the veracity of information received from collaborators or assets.
*   **Espionage & Covert Operations:** As an agent of the Beehive, Cyran undoubtedly possesses significant skills in infiltration, information gathering, disguise, analysis, and secure communication. His sustained operation within NUL-aligned territory points to considerable proficiency in maintaining cover and avoiding detection.
*   **Elven Traits:** Benefits from natural elven attributes, including keen senses useful for observation and an ability to remain alert with minimal rest (trance).
*   **Potential Shapeshifting/Animal Messenger Use:** The owl incident suggests a possible ability to communicate through or assume animal forms, consistent with both druidic practice and espionage techniques.

---

#### Affiliations

*   **[[About the world/Nations/Llerathian Empire\|Llerathian Empire]] (Beehive - Intelligence Branch):** His primary allegiance and operational command.
*   **[[House Godric\|House Godric]]:** His Llerathian family of origin.
*   **[[About the world/People/Brother Ash\|Brother Ash]]:** His brother, also serving Llerath, potentially in a different capacity (Templar Missionary).
*   **Adventuring Groups (e.g., associates of [[Toan\|Toan]]):** Interacts with and potentially hires or directs adventurers for specific tasks beneficial to Llerathian interests.

---

#### Notable Events or Achievements

*   **Osterrend Plague Investigation (c. 56 UL):** Under his druid persona, Cyran posted a substantial reward seeking adventurers to collect rare components (specifically the algae Calen Redhi from the Santorkai caves) purportedly for a cure to the plague affecting Osterrend's outskirts. His true motives for this mission remain unclear but were suspected by some observers.
*   **Briefing for "Protest" / Final Mission (c. 57 UL):** Met with adventurers in his hut near Osterrend to prepare them for a mission vaguely termed a "protest." Employed a truth-compelling enchantment during this briefing to ensure the adventurers' honesty before potentially revealing more about the operation's true objectives. This event appears linked to significant unfolding events in Osterrend.

---

#### Allies and Enemies

*   **Allies:** [[About the world/People/Brother Ash\|Brother Ash]] (Family), operatives and superiors within the Llerathian Beehive, [[About the world/Nations/Llerathian Empire\|Llerathian Empire]]. Individuals or groups contracted for specific missions (temporary).
*   **Enemies:** [[NUL\|NUL]] counter-intelligence, [[About the world/Organisations/The Cause\|The Cause]], any factions or individuals actively working against Llerathian interests in the region. His undercover status makes anyone potentially suspicious of his true motives an enemy.

---

#### Equipment or Artifacts

*   **Druidic Implements:** Likely carries items consistent with his druid persona (staff, herbs, natural focuses).
*   **Covert Gear:** May possess concealed communication devices, codes, or other equipment standard for Beehive agents.
*   **Secure Location:** Maintains access to a private hut used for secure briefings.

---

#### Current Role

As of 59 UL, Cyran Leowenis appears to be actively engaged in intelligence operations in or around the city of [[About the world/Nations/Osterrend\|Osterrend]]. Under the guise of an independent druid, he monitors local developments, recruits external assets for specific tasks, and coordinates actions aligned with the strategic objectives of the Llerathian Beehive. His recent activities involve preparing adventurers for a significant, potentially disruptive, event within Osterrend.

---

#### Quotes

*   *"Buenas noches compañero."* (Good evening, comrade/partner.) - Reportedly spoken by an owl, possibly acting as his messenger or familiar.
*   *"What do you think will happen today?"* / *"How do you feel about what we have learned?"* (Examples of questions reportedly asked under a truth-compelling enchantment during a briefing).

---
