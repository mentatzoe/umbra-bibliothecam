#### Overview

Primus Vindicator Lemons, formerly designated Hopeful 2841, is the current head of the [[About the world/Nations/Llerathian Empire\|Llerathian Empire]]'s **Thorn Council** and a formidable military figure. 

A human of imposing build, distinguished by his striking white hair and the facial scars of past battles (including a lost and later restored eye), Lemons is a product of the Llerathian Hive system. He trained alongside [[Theren Liadon\|Theren Liadon]] and [[Keith\|Keith]] before graduating via the Spring Games. Lemons played an essential role in the rescue of Goddess [[About the world/Higher powers/Lux Aeterna\|Lux Aeterna]] during the NUL invasion of 55 UL, advocating fiercely for change. 

His appointment as the first male **Primus** to lead a major Temple Branch came via the **Citric Edict** issued by Lux herself later in 55 UL, directly linking his rise to the crisis and his demands for a renewed, decisive approach. 

Tasked with embodying a vigorous enforcement of Order, Primus Vindicator Lemons is seen as the uncompromising sword arm of Lux's will, overseeing military readiness, the integration of annexed territories, and the decisive punishment of heresy and chaos, often in coordination with [[About the world/Organisations/Her Enlightened Enquiry\|Her Enlightened Enquiry]].

#### Background

Originating from the Llerathian Hive system, Lemons was known only as 2841 throughout his upbringing and **Hopeful** training. This system shaped his worldview towards duty and loyalty to Lux. Assigned to a demanding training squad under Inquisitor [[Bel'Dath\|Bel'Dath]], alongside [[About the world/People/Primus Inquisitor Theren Liadon\|Theren Liadon]], [[About the world/People/Primus Aegis Keith\|Keith]] (7313), and the Volunteer Gael ([[About the world/People/Leah Orcisia Malek\|Leah Orcisia Malek]]), his notably tall and strong human physique set him apart within the predominantly elven Llerathian structure. His training focused on combat, discipline, tactical execution, and survival skills. A significant early mission for Lemons involved searching for and securing unauthorized magic users, a task leading to the capture and long-term custody of the elf River Sidell. He successfully completed the Spring Games trials in 55 UL, earning the rank of **Initiate**. He chose the name "Lemons," a name some whisper was connected to River Sidell, reputedly due to his often stern or focused expression.

Lemons' career was dramatically and rapidly accelerated following the NUL invasion of 55 UL. Witnessing the failures exposed by the crisis and playing an essential role in the Goddess's rescue, he became a forceful advocate for change. Later that same year, Lux Aeterna issued the **Citric Edict**, removing Prima Mater Daphne from leadership of the Thorn Council and appointing Lemons as the first **Primus** (male head) of a major Temple Branch. This historic appointment was a direct response to the invasion, the need for a decisive leader, and Lemons' vocal demands for a new era of strict enforcement and military readiness. His subsequent appointment as Primus Vindicator reinforced this mandate.

#### Personality

Primus Vindicator Lemons embodies the discipline and focus of the Hive system, coupled with a pragmatic, action-oriented, and often stern approach forged in crisis. His directness and physical courage were evident from his Hopeful years, readily engaging threats head-on and even facing down authority when necessary for a mission's integrity. He values structure and order with an unwavering conviction, maintaining a low tolerance for dissent or inefficiency that could compromise Imperial security.

While his official demeanor is one of unyielding resolve – sometimes perceived as perpetually sour, leading to his chosen name – glimpses of a dry, perhaps even sardonic, sense of humor emerge. He is known for deadpan remarks like "I sense heresy," or being associated with items bearing unexpected, direct messages like "REPENT." This hints at a complex individual beneath the stern exterior. Moments of camaraderie with squadmates, such as high-fiving Keith, and the use of improvised weapons such as large instruments, are also noted. His experiences during the invasion and his rapid elevation solidified his resolve, making him a fierce proponent of Lux's will.
