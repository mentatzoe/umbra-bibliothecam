First-born of the Von Kunner family ([[About the world/Nations/Osterrend\|Osterrend]] de facto Nobility), Dietrich showed an affinity for magical constructs from a very early age.

As part of a commercial agreement, Jurgen von Kunner, current head of the Kunner family, arranged a marriage between Dietrich and [[Vivianne Rothtopper\|Vivianne Rothtopper]], the current queen regent of [[Criosia\|Criosia]] right before she was born.

To fulfil this agreement, the boy would have to live in their lands and be trained in magic essentials in the Magical University of Criosia (Damaris University), for which he moved to the Rothtopper residence at the age of 8.
