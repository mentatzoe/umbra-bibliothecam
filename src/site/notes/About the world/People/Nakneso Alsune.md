#### Overview

Nakneso "Nak" Asulne is a skilled Drow operative, primarily known for his tenure as an early member of the adventuring group [[About the world/Organisations/The Cheese Company\|The Cheese Company]], joining shortly after its founding in 55 UL. Possessing the distinct traits of his people, Nak excels in stealth, infiltration, and deception, augmenting these skills with subtle arcane abilities. Operating with a philosophy prioritizing personal independence and often employing dishonesty, he proved a valuable, if unpredictable, asset during several key missions undertaken by the Company between 55 UL and approximately 57-58 UL, before his departure under unclear circumstances. His current whereabouts and activities remain unknown.

---

#### Background

Nakneso Asulne is a Root Elf, estimated to be around 35 years of age as of 59 UL. Specific details regarding his place of birth or upbringing—whether connected to known Drow settlements like [[Himbadihr\|Himbadihr]] or perhaps raised elsewhere—are not recorded in available chronicles concerning his time with [[About the world/Organisations/The Cheese Company\|The Cheese Company]]. His demonstrated skills in disguise, infiltration, and misdirection strongly suggest a life spent navigating the shadows and perhaps operating outside established societal norms before encountering the adventurers. He professes a profound debt and loyalty to an unnamed mentor, whom he describes cryptically as "a horrible person who's probably rotting in jail somewhere," indicating a formative relationship rooted in complex, potentially illicit, circumstances. Nak joined [[Calliope\|Calliope]], [[About the world/People/Guan Dao\|Guan Dao]], and [[Dominik\|Dominik]] around 55 UL, shortly after they founded The Cheese Company.

---

#### Personality

Nak embodies a spirit of **chaotic independence**, valuing his freedom above established rules or allegiances ("Independence. I am a free spirit—no one tells me what to do."). He possesses a deeply ingrained habit of dishonesty, readily admitting, "I lie about almost everything, even when there's no good reason to." He justifies this by claiming a unique ability to perceive value where others do not, sometimes showing unusual interest in mundane objects like talking stones found in caves. This inclination towards fabrication is coupled with a strong conviction in his own perceptive abilities and immunity to deception ("I'm convinced that no one could ever fool me the way I fool others."). Despite this seemingly untrustworthy nature, his actions while with The Cheese Company indicated a functional, if sometimes self-serving, loyalty. He could be counted on to apply his unique skills, such as expertly disguising [[Peace\|Peace]]'s Tiefling features, yet also demonstrated a frustrating tendency to vanish without warning, as noted during the company's journey to Simpa. His primary loyalty appears tied to his mysterious, imprisoned mentor.

---

#### Appearance

Nak is a Drow male with the characteristic **dark skin** of his people. He has **long, white hair** and striking **blue eyes**. He stands at approximately 1.90m (around 6'3"). His heritage grants him exceptional vision in darkness but makes him sensitive to bright sunlight.

---

#### Abilities and Skills

Nak possesses a unique blend of inherent Drow capabilities and acquired roguish talents:

*   **Drow Heritage:** Like others of his kind, Nak possesses superior vision in complete darkness, allowing him to navigate subterranean environments or nighttime conditions with ease. Conversely, he is sensitive to bright sunlight, hindering his effectiveness in direct daylight. He also demonstrates a natural resistance to effects that induce magical sleep. Furthermore, he can innately conjure flickering motes of light, cause foes to shimmer with revealing faerie fire, and summon spheres of magical darkness.
*   **Mastery of Stealth & Subterfuge:** Nak exhibits exceptional agility and reflexes, making him highly adept at moving unseen, bypassing locks, disarming traps, and employing disguises (such as concealing [[Peace\|Peace]]'s Tiefling horns). His proficiency with specialized tools and understanding of coded languages (Thieves' Cant) underscores his specialization in infiltration and deception.
*   **Combat Prowess:** In combat, Nak favors finesse and opportunism. He wields lighter weapons such as hand crossbows, daggers (including a silvered one from Lubnice), rapiers, and shortswords with proficiency. He possesses a keen ability to identify and exploit openings in an opponent's defense, delivering particularly damaging strikes when they are distracted or vulnerable. His reflexes allow him to instinctively mitigate harm from certain attacks and nimbly avoid area hazards.
*   **Arcane Trickery:** Nak complements his mundane skills with subtle arcane manipulations. He can conjure an invisible, spectral hand to manipulate objects, trigger mechanisms, or retrieve small items from afar. He is capable of creating minor illusions, potentially including illusory duplicates of himself to confuse opponents, influencing the minds of others to hold them immobile, and forming temporary blades seemingly woven from shadowstuff.
