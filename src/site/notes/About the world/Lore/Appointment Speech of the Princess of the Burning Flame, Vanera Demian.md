### Overview

The speech delivered by Vanera Demian circa **55 UL / 1046 Continental**, upon her formal appointment as "Princess of the Burning Flame," stands as a significant piece of anti-Llerathian testimony circulating within [[NUL\|NUL]] territories. It recounts her traumatic origins within the [[About the world/Nations/Llerathian Empire\|Llerathian]] Hive system and her violent transformation at the hands of [[Inquisitor Astraea\|Inquisitor Astraea]], events she explicitly places during the heightened tensions of the **Second Freedom War (39-41 UL)**. The speech functions as both a powerful declaration of loyalty to her benefactor, [[About the world/People/Lady Demian\|Lady Demian]], and a carefully crafted piece of political rhetoric, designed to highlight the perceived hypocrisy and cruelty of Lux's regime while reinforcing core NUL values of freedom and arcane acceptance.

---

### Context

Delivered around **55 UL / 1046 Continental**—a period likely marked by recent NUL successes or ongoing tensions following events like the [[About the world/History/Sansi Civil War\|Sansi Civil War]]—Vanera's speech occurred during her formal induction into [[About the world/People/Lady Demian\|Lady Demian]]'s powerful inner circle in Dhirdam. This elevation granted her a platform before influential NUL figures. By anchoring the destruction of Hive 81 within the Second Freedom War era, Vanera contextualizes the extreme actions of [[About the world/Organisations/Her Enlightened Enquiry\|Inquisitor Astraea]] within a period of known conflict and potential Llerathian overreach, lending credibility to her narrative of state-sanctioned brutality against perceived deviants. The speech serves to solidify her position, publicly denounce her former homeland, and galvanize support for Lady Demian and the NUL cause.

### The Speech

> "Good evening. Lady Demian, esteemed members of the circle, honoured guests.
>
> Tonight, I ask you to share with me the significance of this moment. As you join me in becoming the Princess of the Burning Flame, we celebrate the unity that keeps us free.
>
> This is more than an honour; it is a recognition, a testament shared by all in this room, that the Freedom of our United Nations is not merely an ideal, but a hard-won reality.
>
> I was not born into such freedom. Many of you know my story, but some truths bear repeating, lest we forget the liberty we are here to protect, the chains we swore to break. 
> 
> This is the story of how Llerath's 'Light' tried to incinerate me, only to ignite my quest for Freedom:
>
> I grew up within the cold, structured 'order' of the [[About the world/Nations/Llerathian Empire\|Llerathian Empire]]: A Hive child. No, I did not always look like this.
>
> I was raised by the faceless Mother of the Temple, bred for the only purpose of being brainwashed to serve a megalomaniac lunatic who filled her existential void with a thirst for conquest. A **spell-caster** who dresses her delusion as divinity. A powerful one, yes, but also one who trembles at the thought of true arcane freedom.
>
> Why else declare all magic but her own 'chaotic' and 'dangerous'? That isn't divine wisdom, that is the sound of profound fear. Fear of being challenged, fear of being equaled, fear of being exposed as nothing more than a powerful, paranoid spell-caster.
>
> Claiming herself a Goddess, risen from the ashes of the Cataclysm, she promised peace and protection. But her promises built on our subservience, her 'peace' maintained by our chains! She seized a void in power, preyed on the fear left by the abyssal destruction, offering security only to those who sacrificed their very being to her Light and Order!
>
> And what is the foundation of this 'Order'? A dogma of control built on fear and prejudice!
>
> Their dogma declares that magic itself, the very force that drives innovation and empowers us, is inherently chaotic, a dangerous power to be locked away, controlled only by Her chosen few!
>
> They preach that men are inherently feeble, incapable of controlling base impulses, fit only to be guided –nay, ruled– by their 'enlightened' matriarchy!
>
> They whisper that our natural instincts, the very essence of life's diversity, are 'chaotic' unless bent solely to Her will and purpose!
>
> Their scriptures hint, or outright declare, that entire peoples -including some bearing lineages seated here tonight!– are inherently flawed, seeded by an unnamed darkness, put in this world just to disrupt it.
>
> And their ultimate solution to dissent, to difference? Not understanding. Not integration. But violence. Order maintained not by Light, but by the absolute authority to extinguish any flame they did not kindle.
>
> It's not better for those 'born' within. Hive children are abominations. I was never born, but created. Driven by the insatiable thirst of the Empire's Branches, I was moulded as a part of their imperial machine. I have no father or mother, and like many of us, I didn't even have a name of my own.
>
> Hive children are grown and pruned to serve the needs of the temple, raised in a world where nothing in life is free, pushed to a state of such deprivation that turning to the Goddess and her so-called love seems like the only solution.
>
> Hive 81. You don't see much of the others outside of standard training, and you're told even less, but I could see it. I always had the feeling that we were different. Less homogenous, less compliant. Less blinded by Her Light. 'The Indomitable,' we whispered among ourselves, clinging to some small spark of identity.
>
> For the Branches? I never knew what our purpose was, but I have made peace with this: We were an experiment. Just like our great scientists seek to find the underlying truths of the natural and the arcane through hypothesis and tests, they use Hive children. We were blind in our own trial: there to be monitored, assessed, and ultimately... Pruned.
>
> The ruthlessness hidden behind the Llerathian Dogma became horrifyingly clear to me during the darkness of the last great Freedom War.
>
> Returning from a brief, stolen moment of youthful defiance outside the Hive walls, I saw the sky ablaze with an unnatural purple glow. A chilling premonition seized me. I ran through the forest, skipped mountain scree, arriving at the cliffs overlooking my home just in time to see it ablaze.
>
> And there she stood, Sworn Sister Inquisitor Astraea –a name spoken with fear even within [[About the world/Organisations/Her Enlightened Enquiry\|Her Enlightened Enquiry]]'s own ranks–, silhouetted against the inferno. Not for inspection, not for guidance, but the gleaming crystal in her hand, channeled the very 'Light' she claimed to serve into an instrument of annihilation.
>
> The carefully hidden anxieties of our 'Mothers,' the small, unusual kindnesses before curfew… it all clicked into place with sickening clarity. The experiment had come to a conclusion: what the Empire cannot tame, it must destroy.
>
> "Why?" The question surprised myself as it tore from my throat. "Why have you done this?"
>
> Her gaze, those piercing yellow eyes, swept over me with chilling indifference. “Because you are ungrateful,” she pronounced, her voice devoid of warmth. “Selfish. Possessive. Your… deviations… challenged the path of the Light. Redemption was impossible. Your rebellion proved the darkness within. A pathway for entropy.”
>
> Darkness? Our darkness? We, who only yearned for the simple things– a family’s warmth, the freedom to question, to be like the rest of the world? How could she preach of a Goddess of Life while extinguishing lives with such casual cruelty? How could that same Goddess who boasted of being the embodiment of life's essence, yet abandoned the very life she had created? 
> 
> In that moment, watching my world burn, I saw the lie at the heart of Llerath. We weren’t children of the Light; we were kindling. Expendable cogs in their machine of 'order.'
>
> "Lies!" I screamed, rage and grief warring within me. "We just wanted to exist! Why must we be different? Why serve a power that treats us as… less?"
>
> Before she could answer, a deafening crack echoed as the Hive’s structure groaned and gave way. Floors collapsed inwards, taking with them… everyone. Friends. Brothers. Sisters-in-all-but-blood. The faces of those I would never see again flashed before my eyes.
>
> Desperation birthed a final, desperate gamble. I threw myself at Astraea's feet. "I VOLUNTEER!" I pleaded, the words choked by sobs. "I'll serve! Renounce everything! I will fight! I will pass the Spring Games! I will earn my place! Lux *must understand! Her Light couldn't want this! Sister… the Code… you must grant me this!"*
>
> Silence, save for the roaring fire and the crashing storm. Then, she bent down, offering a hand. For a fleeting instant, a flicker of something – pity? Amusement? – crossed her face before hardening back into Temple discipline. “Rise, child.”
>
> She helped me up, even wiped a tear with a gesture almost… kind. And then I saw the truth in her eyes.
>
> "It is too late for you," she whispered, her grip tightening on my face, lifting me until her chilling smile filled my vision. "Corrupt. Rotten. *Chaotic.* You will *never* approach the purity of The Goddess. You are but a misstep that should be corrected… And you wish to fight? To prove your worth? You believe Lux will hear you?" Her eyes gleamed with malice. 
> 
> "Fine. Prove it. Cling to the despicable existence you deserve. Flee. Survive. And perhaps, one day, if the Goddess wills it, you will understand the power of *true Light.*" She raised her prism, and the world fractured. 
>
> A sensation of being torn apart, soul from body… A terrifying glimpse of cold, vast emptiness… then overwhelming pain.
>
> When consciousness returned, it was to this."
>
> \[Vanera gestures pointedly to her Tiefling features – horns, tail, skin tone]
>
> "My reflection… a monster -or so I was led to believe-, crafted by the very 'Light' that claimed to offer salvation.
>
> What happened to Hive 81 is not just my past; it is a chilling preview of the 'order' Llerath seeks to impose upon all of Tinnuith. They see our diversity, our freedom, our magic as chaos to be purged!
>
> ***That*** is the 'purity' Astraea defended.
>
> But from that fire, from that pain, a different flame was kindled within me.
>
> A flame nurtured by true strength, true loyalty, true freedom: the freedom granted by my Lady Demian. A burning desire for a world in which all are free to exist as they are, to explore the arcane as it exists in nature, to organise themselves as they see fit, to achieve a decent and satisfying life.
>
> And above all else, a life in peace -based on genuine agreement freely arrived at by equals- without the threat of assimilation into an Empire to quench the delusions of grandeur of a mortal.
>
> Join me today as I pledge my loyalty, my skills, and my fire to the Union for the Survival of the Arcane Arts, and the great Nations United for Liberty, and my Lady Demian. What we have achieved in liberty, we will surpass in greater liberty.
>
> Here, under Lady Demian's guidance, within the strength of our United Nations, I found not just refuge, but purpose. Here, my fire is not a flaw to be extinguished, but a force to be wielded for true liberty!
>
> Because... **who needs Gods, when we have magic?**"

### Analysis and Reception

Vanera Demian's appointment speech quickly became a notable piece of political theatre within the NUL. Its power lies in its skillful blend of harrowing personal narrative and sharp ideological attack against Llerath. By vividly recounting the destruction of Hive 81 and her forced transformation during the Second Freedom War, Vanera provides compelling "evidence" of Llerathian cruelty and the supposed failure of Lux's divine order, particularly under duress.

The speech effectively leverages common NUL criticisms of Llerath: the suppression of magic, perceived matriarchal oppression, dismissal of individual identity (through the Hive system), and the use of violence to enforce conformity. Framing Lux as a powerful but fearful spell-caster rather than a true goddess directly plays into NUL's foundational beliefs.

While presented as factual testimony, the speech is undeniably crafted. It simplifies complex Llerathian structures (like the Volunteer system) into straightforward narratives of oppression and uses emotionally charged language to elicit sympathy and outrage. Its timing and delivery within Lady Demian's influential circle likely served to bolster Vanera's standing, showcase Demian's power in "rescuing" such individuals, and reinforce NUL unity against the external Llerathian threat. The circulation of this testimony, whether through official channels or word-of-mouth, continues to fuel anti-Llerathian sentiment across the Free Nations.
