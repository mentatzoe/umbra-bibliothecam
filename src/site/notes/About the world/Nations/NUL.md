The **Nations United for Liberty** (commonly referred to as the **NUL** or the **Confederation**) dominates the southeastern continent of Tinnuith as a federal magocracy. Comprising sixteen sovereign city-states, the NUL stands as the industrial and arcane superpower of the modern era. Founded on principles of individual freedom, magical deregulation, and meritocracy, it serves as the ideological antithesis to the theocratic Llerathian Empire in the north. Their national motto, _"Who needs gods when you have magic?"_ defines a culture where progress is worshiped and power is earned rather than ordained.

## History

The NUL rose from the ashes of the **Cataclysm (980 HC)**. As Lux Aeterna consolidated the northern lands into a theocracy, the southern independent states faced a choice. They could submit or they could unify.

### The Pact of Preservation (992 HC)

The **Purge of Himbadihr (991 HC)** served as the catalyst for union. Llerathian forces exterminated populations of "tainted" races, proving that neutrality offered no protection. In response, representatives from four major powers convened in the Almarosan archipelago. **Dhirdam** (Industry), **Almarosa** (Finance), **Osterrend** (Technology), and **Chuya** (Nature) signed the _Pact for the Preservation of the Arcane Arts_. This document established a mutual defense fund and a customs union.

### The Industrial Expansion (996–1005 HC)

Under the leadership of the first Chancellor, **Liorne Imaeth**, the NUL underwent a radical transformation known as the "Dhirdam Miracle." The introduction of mass-manufacturing and black powder technology triggered an economic boom. This prosperity drew neighboring states into the fold. **Galrea**, **Molheim**, **Kruce**, **AlSaib**, and **Bredapert** petitioned for entry to access federal industrial patents.

### The Freedom Wars (999–1036 HC)

The confederation was forged in fire during the **First** and **Second Freedom Wars** against Llerath. The conflict necessitated the annexation of strategic military assets. This expansion brought the fortress-cities of **Astagion**, **Adriaria**, **Vilin**, and the necromantic isles of **Talatos** into the union. The wars concluded with the **Treaty of Ash** in 1036 HC. The NUL emerged battered but sovereign, holding the line at the charred ruins of Tevara.

## Government and Politics

The NUL functions not as a democracy but as a **Magocracy** with plutocratic elements. Governance resides with the **High Council**, seated in the Iron Pyramid of Dhirdam.

- **The Weighted Vote:** While representatives are elected or appointed by their home cities, their voting power in the Council is weighted. Influence depends on a constituency's **Magical Prowess**, **Economic Output**, and **Strategic Value**.
    
- **Federal Authority:** The central government controls the military, foreign policy, and inter-state trade. Domestic laws such as zoning, policing, and education remain the domain of the individual City-States.
    
- **Key Ministries:**
    
    - **Office of the Chancellor:** Liorne Imaeth (Executive Power).
        
    - **Ministry of Science:** Dr. Mendez (Research & Ethics).
        
    - **Ministry of Defense:** Governor-Admiral Albert Florenza (Military Command).
        

## The Sixteen City-States

The NUL comprises sixteen member states. Each specializes in a specific facet of the nation's survival.

## Military: The Protection Corps

The **NUL Protection Corps (NPC)** serves as the overarching federal military. Unlike the Llerathian Templars who rely on divine favor, the NPC relies on **Combined Arms Doctrine**.

- **Superior Firepower:** NUL doctrine emphasizes range and overwhelming force. They utilize Osterrendi airships for bombardment, Dhirdami black powder muskets for infantry, and Vilin's energy cells to power heavy siege wards.
    
- **The Ash Battalions:** Composed of refugees and conscripts, these units hold the border forts along the Tevaran waste.
    
- **Special Forces:** The **Half Moon Legion** (Astagion), **Blazing Shields** (Adriaria), and **Gossamer Agency** (Bredapert) operate as elite specialized units under federal command.
    

## Economy

The NUL operates as the economic engine of Tinnuith. Its supply chain is vertically integrated across the continent:

1. **Raw Materials** are extracted in the west (**Galrea**, **Molheim**).
    
2. **Processing** occurs in the industrial north (**Dhirdam**, **Osterrend**).
    
3. **Distribution** is managed by the trade hubs (**AlSaib**, **Astagion**).
    
4. **Financing** is underwritten by the banks of **Almarosa** and audited by **Kruce**.
    

This interdependence ensures that no single city can secede without economic collapse. It binds the confederation together more tightly than any law.

## Culture and Society

**"Individualism is Rewarded."**

Nulian society is fiercely meritocratic. Social standing is rarely determined by birth but by magical aptitude, wealth, or technical skill. This has created a dynamic, high-mobility society that draws immigrants from across the world. However, it also creates stark inequality. The "Magnesia" slums of Dhirdam act as the dark reflection of Almarosa's marble palaces.

**The Godless Ethos**

While private worship is legal in some states (Almarosa, AlSaib), the Federation is culturally atheistic. Citizens view gods as dangerous, capricious entities that threaten free will. They see magic as the ultimate expression of mortal agency, a tool to shape the universe rather than a means to beg for favors. This fundamental worldview puts them at eternal odds with the faithful of Llerath.
