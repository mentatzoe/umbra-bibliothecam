**Talatos** is the southernmost territory of the NUL, an archipelago of windswept islands and whitewashed cliffs known colloquially as the "Pale Isles." As the confederation's center for metaphysical study and biological perfection, Talatos is defined by its mastery over the cycle of life and death. Unlike their northern necromantic counterparts, the Talati view the body not as a cage, but as a vessel to be sculpted, healed, and perfected to better house the spirit.

## History and Geography

The Talati archipelago consists of three major islands characterized by arid plains, rocky shores, and deep limestone grottos. The architecture is distinct from the mainland, featuring cubic, whitewashed stone structures with azure domes designed to reflect the harsh southern sun.

Historically an independent thalassocracy, Talatos maintained neutrality until the **First Freedom War**. In **1005 HC**, facing the threat of a Llerathian naval blockade, the High Necromancer signed the Treaty of Integration with the NUL. This alliance proved critical; Talati "Ghost-Ships" secured supply lines, while their **Biomancers** provided critical field medicine, regenerating lost limbs and purging magical blights from soldiers on the front lines.

## Society and Politics

The city is governed by the **Necromantic Circle**, a council currently led by **High Necromancer Lysara Talan**. The Circle is divided into two disciplines: the **Callers** (Spirit-Binders) and the **Shapers** (Biomancers).

A significant cultural friction exists between Talatos and the **Kingdom of Criosia**, known as the "Schism of Bone and Breath." While Criosia practices Corporeal Necromancy (reanimating dead tissue), Talatos practices **Vitalism** and **Ethereal Necromancy**. Talati society views the Criosian use of rotting zombies as unhygienic and crude. Instead, they focus on *preserving* the living form or communing with the departed spirit.

### The Grottos of Genesis
Beneath the pristine white city lie the **Grottos**, restricted laboratories where the Shapers practice advanced Biomancy. Rumors persist of "Perfected Vessels"—humanoids grown or modified alchemically to be free of disease or defect. While officially described as medical research, these practices act as a magnet for the wealthy seeking longevity or cosmetic perfection.

## Economy and Culture

The economy is built on **Soul-Commerce** and **Medical Tourism**. The wealthy of the NUL often travel to the Pale Isles for "Rejuvenation Therapies" that blend alchemy and biomancy to reverse aging or repair catastrophic injuries.

*   **Labor**: Manual labor is performed by the living, assisted by **Poltergeist Rigging** (bound spirits manipulating sails/cranes).
*   **Gastronomy**: The diet is austere and preservative-heavy. Staples include salt-cured fish, olives, and "Ambrosia," a nutrient-dense algal paste cultivated by biomancers that sustains the body with minimal consumption.
*   **Heraldry**: The flag displays a white human skull with blooming flowers growing from the eye sockets, set against a field of deep oceanic blue.
*   **Magic**: The dominant disciplines are **Spiritualism** and **Biomancy**. Talati mages excel at knitting flesh and piercing the Veil. It is whispered that the Shapers have achieved the ability to create life from alchemical slurry, though such "Vat-Born" are rarely seen in public.
