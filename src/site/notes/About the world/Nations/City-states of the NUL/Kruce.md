# Kruce

**Kruce** serves as the bureaucratic heart of the NUL. Centered in the **Isos Basin**, this city of wide boulevards, tiled plazas, and domed archives represents order manifest. While Osterrend builds the machines and Almarosa funds them, Kruce provides the essential infrastructure of law, logistics, and standardization. **Arithmancy**, the magical application of geometry and logic, defines the city. Here, scholars tame the world's chaotic energies into predictable, repeatable patterns.

## History and Geography

Kruce straddles the **River Isos**. Engineers have artificially straightened the waterways into a grid of precise canals to maximize shipping efficiency. Surveyors have meticulously mapped the surrounding flat basin, accounting for every acre of farmland in the city's grand ledger.

Before the NUL, Kruce stood as the **Free City of Measures**. It served as the continent's neutral ground for standardization. The city housed the "Prime Weights," the physical objects defining the exact weight of a pound or the length of a meter for regional trade. This history as a neutral arbiter made Kruce the natural choice to administer the NUL's federal bureaucracy following the annexation of **998 HC**.

## Society and Politics

The **Arithmantic Conclave**, a meritocratic body of scholars and administrators led by **High Arch-Logician Thesek Varo**, manages governance. Kruce functions as the "Civil Service" of the NUL. Its diplomats and auditors station themselves in every other city-state to ensure federal taxes are paid and resource quotas are met.

The social hierarchy is academic. Status depends not on birth but on one's **Grade**. Citizens achieve this rank through rigorous testing in logic, magical theory, and administration.

### The Question of Agency

Kruce acts as the epicenter of the **Construct Rights Movement**. While the artificers of Osterrend build the physical shells of the **Construct-Born**, the Arithmancers of Kruce weave the **Logos**. These complex magical ciphers grant the machines true sentience.

Because Kruceans view intelligence as the only metric of personhood, they recognize Awakened Constructs as full citizens. This philosophy creates a legal and cultural standoff with the industrial cities of Dhirdam and Molheim, where owners often view constructs as property. Consequently, Kruce has become a sanctuary for "Runaway Gears," constructs fleeing servitude to gain legal recognition in the Basin.

## Economy and Culture

Kruce acts as the confederation's **Auditor**. The export of **Expertise** drives the economy. When a bridge collapses in Galrea or a supply line fails in Vilin, governments hire Krucean engineers to fix the equation.

- **Gastronomy:** A legendary coffee house culture permeates the city. Intellectuals gather in open-air cafes to debate theorems over cups of **Qahwa**, a bitter stimulant brew, and **Geometric Pastries** (savory, layered doughs folded into precise shapes).
    
- **Heraldry:** The flag features a golden compass and square set against a field of grid-lined parchment white.
    
- **Magic:** The dominant discipline is **Arithmancy** (Geometry and Logic). This practice strips magic of mysticism. Kruceans do not "cast" spells; they "proof" them. This slow, ritualistic, and stable form of magic primarily serves architecture, warding, and the creation of the Logos.
