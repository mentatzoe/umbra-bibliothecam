**Dhirdam** is the capital city of the NUL and its largest industrial metropolis. Defined by the massive iron pyramid at its center, the city serves as the seat of the High Council and the primary manufacturing hub for the confederation's magical artefacts. Built upon the ruins of a 10th-century university destroyed by Llerathian forces, Dhirdam stands as a testament to industrial magical engineering.

## History and Geography

The city is physically divided between the **Iron Pyramid**, a windowless structure of black metal and glass, and the **Outskirts**, a surrounding ring of factories, refineries, and high-density housing.

The Pyramid was constructed in 992 following the "Purge of the Abyssal," when Llerathian forces razed the original settlement. The architecture of the central district is brutalist and imposing, designed to withstand siege and project stability. While the interior of the Pyramid features magically climate-controlled parks and hydroponic gardens, the surrounding Outskirts are characterized by perpetual smog and the glow of magical exhaust vents.

## Society and Politics

Governance in Dhirdam is strictly stratified. Access to the city's vertical levels is determined by a seven-tier clearance system.

*   **High Tasani**: Reserved for the inner circle of the NUL leadership.
*   **Tasani**: NUL confederation official diplomatic pass.
*   **Amarasu**: NUL Protection Corps command and barracks.
*   **Theria**: Commercial license holders and merchants.
*   **Neboz**: General employees and laborers.
*   **Elenia**: House service and maintenance staff.
*   **Magnesia**: Free access zones, housing the displaced and unemployed.

Social stratification is codified into law. Movement between tiers requires temporary transit passes, and unauthorized access to upper levels is a felony enforced by the Protection Corps. The lowest level, Magnesia, often absorbs displaced populations from across the continent, creating high-density slum conditions.

## Economy and Culture

Dhirdam is the industrial engine of the NUL. Its economy is driven by the mass production of convenience items such as self-heating pots, endless torches, and cleaning charms that are exported across the continent. This industrial focus has created a culture that values efficiency and utility over aesthetics.

*   **Gastronomy**: The local diet is defined by convenience. Street food stalls serving hot noodle bowls and skewered meats are common in the Outskirts to cater to shift workers. In the lower tiers, nutrient-dense ration bars are a staple.
*   **Heraldry**: The city flag features a silver pyramid with a single eye at the peak.
*   **Settlements**: The city relies on satellite settlements like **Steelhaven** and **Coldwater** to maintain its massive population.
