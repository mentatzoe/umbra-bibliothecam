**Adriaria**, the "Shield of the East," stands as the NUL’s impenetrable coastal fortress. Carved into the crimson limestone cliffs of the **Gulf of Embers**, the city guards the eastern maritime approach from the Llerathian Empire. This marvel of military engineering reinforces physical stone with permanent walls of solid fire and force-woven abjuration. While the Astagioni fleet projects power across the seas, Adriaria ensures no enemy foot ever touches the NUL heartland. In this city of eternal vigilance, every citizen acts as a reservist, and every building functions as a bunker.

## History and Geography

Adriaria clings vertically to a jagged cliff face, creating a natural amphitheater facing the eastern ocean. The architecture features whitewashed stone keeps with terracotta roofs, lending the city a deceptive beauty that masks its heavy fortifications.

The **Ever-Burning Wall**, a massive barrier of suspended magical fire encircling the harbor, defines the skyline. Originally a loose coalition of mercenary guilds, Adriaria petitioned for NUL membership in **1005 HC**. This integration served as a direct response to increasing Llerathian naval aggression in the northern waters. The NUL High Council designated Adriaria as the "Static Anchor" of the eastern defense line, intended to break any Imperial blockade before it could reach the financial hubs of Almarosa.

## Society and Politics

The **Council of Castellans**, a stratocratic body led by **High Castellan Aelric Vaelor**, governs the city. Unlike Astagion’s singular dictatorship, Adriaria operates by committee. The Council represents the commanders of the city’s various defensive sectors: The Wall, The Harbor, and The Sky.

Society is regimented yet communal. The "Civil Defense" mandate for all adults creates a culture valuing discipline over individuality. The population includes a high percentage of **Hell-Kin** and **Fire-Touched**. Their natural resistance to heat makes them uniquely partial to the city's pyromantic defenses.

### The Blazing Shields

The **Blazing Shields** serve as the city's elite defenders. This unit of Battle-Mages specializes in **Abjuration**. They train to create "Force-Woven" domes capable of withstanding heavy bombardment, acting as the NUL's premier heavy infantry.

## Economy and Culture

Adriaria’s economy acts as the "Anvil" to Astagion’s "Hammer." The city manufactures the confederation's heavy defensive infrastructure, including magical sea-mines, warding pylons, and the impenetrable hull-plating used on NUL warships.

- **Gastronomy:** The Adriarian diet is rich and spicy, heavily influenced by the sea and trade with AlSaib. **Ember-Glazed Pork** (roasted meats coated in a spicy pepper-honey glaze) and **Salt-Crusted Sea Bass** are local staples. Locals pair these with heavy red wines grown in the volcanic soil of the cliffs.
    
- **Heraldry:** The flag displays a flaming sword crossed with a silver shield, set against a field of terracotta red.
    
- **Magic:** The dominant disciplines are **Siege Pyromancy** and **Abjuration**. Adriarian mages view magic as architecture. To them, fire is not wild but a brick to be laid. They build walls of force and moats of liquid flame that can burn for centuries without fuel.
