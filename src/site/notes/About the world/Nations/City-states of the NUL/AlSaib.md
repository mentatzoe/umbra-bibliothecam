**AlSaib**, the "Jewel of the Strait," serves as the gateway to the West. Straddling the fractured isthmus separating the NUL heartland from the wild territories of Votar Tok, the city is a fortress of geometric stone, mosaic domes, and ancient secrets. AlSaib operates as the confederation's undisputed trade hub. Here, a signed contract binds more tightly than blood. Commerce provides the only stability in a chaotic world.

## History and Geography

AlSaib controls the **AlSaib Strait**, a treacherous waterway formed during the Era of Settlement when the southern landmass fractured. The city rests directly atop the ruins of **Zahra-Varr**, a pre-human megalithic citadel. The architecture fuses eras. Modern NUL fortifications sit atop elegant, tessellated palaces. These structures rest upon massive cyclopean foundations of fused obsidian, the remnants of the ancient **Dragon Lords**.

The city joined the NUL in **998 HC** for profit rather than safety. Recognizing the industrial boom in Dhirdam, the **Merchant Princes** of AlSaib positioned themselves as the confederation's exclusive logistical partners. This maneuver secured a monopoly on all trade flowing from the dwarven west.

## Society and Politics

The **Gilded Syndicate**, a plutocracy led by **High Magnate Malik al-Saib**, governs the city. Net worth strictly determines political power. The Syndicate auctions seats on the "Council of Coin" annually to the highest bidder.

The **Oath-Keepers of Commerce** (locally known as the _Golden Scale_) regulate society. This order of secular paladins serves no god. Instead, they worship the **Sanctity of the Contract**. In AlSaib, breaking a commercial agreement constitutes capital heresy. The Oath-Keepers act as judge, jury, and executioner for business disputes, enforcing **The Axioms of Exchange** with zealous prejudice.

### The Zahran Lineage

The **Zahran Families** dominate the city's upper echelons. These reclusive dynasties claim direct descent from the rulers of the ancient citadel. They rarely appear in public. Most prefer to conduct business through proxies and heavily guarded intermediaries. Official sources attribute their uncanny longevity to expensive alchemical regimens. However, their aggressive accumulation of wealth and territorial protectiveness fuel whispers that their bloodline is not entirely human.

## Economy and Culture

AlSaib functions as the warehouse of the world. It processes raw goods from the west, such as Dwarven mithral and Orcish furs, and distributes them to NUL industrial centers.

- **The Dungeon Markets:** The ancient ruins beneath the city host the "Undermarket." This sprawling subterranean bazaar facilitates the trade of gray-market goods, from unverified artifacts to exotic creature eggs, far from the prying eyes of Federal NUL inspectors.
    
- **Gastronomy:** Saibian cuisine is fiery and complex, utilizing spices from the far corners of the world. Famous dishes include **clay-baked lamb** with apricots and **Fire-Wine**, a spiced liquor so potent locals humorously refer to it as "Dragon’s Breath."
    
- **Heraldry:** The flag features a golden sun rising over a sea of silver waves, set against a field of turquoise.
    
- **Magic:** The dominant disciplines are **Transmutation** (value/metals) and **Contractual Magic**. Saibian mages act as notaries. A spell cast by them ensures that a party violating a contract suffers immediate physical or financial backlash.
