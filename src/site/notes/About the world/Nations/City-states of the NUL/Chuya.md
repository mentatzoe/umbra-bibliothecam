**Chuya** is a founding city-state of the NUL, located along the northern border near the Principate of Kylthen. Unique among the confederation's members, Chuya is not merely a city built *in* a forest, but a civilization grown *from* it. It stands as the spiritual and ecological conscience of the NUL, formed by the historic union of indigenous druidic circles and elven refugees fleeing the silence of the gods during the Cataclysm.

## History and Geography

Before the formation of the NUL, the region was known as the **Deep Canopy**, home to loose confederations of Firbolg and Human druids who lived in adherence to the "Old Faith." Their society was decentralized and pacifist, possessing no standing army or stone fortifications.

The modern state of Chuya was forged in the fires of the **Cataclysm (980 HC)**. As the gods fell silent and the elven nation of Eldengroth descended into madness and xenophobia, a massive exodus of elven scholars and arcanists fled south. Rather than conquer the indigenous population, the refugees sought sanctuary. In 985 HC, the **Pact of Root and Stone** was sworn: the Elves provided the arcane knowledge to weave defensive barriers and establish political structure, while the Druids shared their connection to the land and spirits.

This union transformed the Deep Canopy into Chuya: a defensible city-state capable of resisting the expansion of the Llerathian Empire. The city limits are porous and vertical, with architecture characterized by living redwood spires grafted with crystalline elven structures.

## Society and Politics

Chuya is governed by the **Council of Elders**, a meritocratic body currently led by **Archdruid Faelys Torr**, a Half-Elf who symbolizes the union of the city's two founding cultures. Political discourse is characterized by "Slow Politics," prioritizing long-term ecological stability over immediate industrial gain.

The city is the cultural home of the **Haze-Walkers** (locally known as the *Khashai*). Originating from elven arcanists who sought to cope with the loss of their divine connection, the Khashai utilize magically cultivated herbs and heavy fumigation as foci for their spellcasting. They view magic not as a weapon, but as a "living breath" that must be inhaled and exhaled. While often dismissed by Dhirdami industrialists as eccentrics, the Khashai serve as the NUL's premier diplomats regarding affairs of nature and the Feywild.

Chuyan society maintains a robust social welfare system. Food and shelter are treated as guaranteed rights, supported by the agricultural surplus created through conjuration magic. This has made the city a primary destination for refugees fleeing the wars in the north.

## Economy and Culture

Chuya maintains a low reliance on mechanical technology, preferring **Natural Magic** and **Druidic Crafting**. The economy is agrarian but highly specialized; the city exports **Conjured Elemental Forces** to other NUL cities. Unlike the bound elementals of industrial regions, Chuyan exports are based on contracts of mutual exchange with the spirits, making them more expensive but significantly more stable.

*   **Gastronomy**: The Chuyan diet is primarily plant-based. Local specialties include hearty mushroom stews, wild berry pastries, and a wide variety of herbal teas known for their restorative and mild psychoactive properties.
*   **Heraldry**: The city flag displays a great tree with a river flowing from its roots, set against a field of forest green.
*   **Magic**: The dominant discipline is **Symbiotic Conjuration**. This practice focuses on the summoning of nature spirits and elementals through pacts and offerings rather than arcane binding.
