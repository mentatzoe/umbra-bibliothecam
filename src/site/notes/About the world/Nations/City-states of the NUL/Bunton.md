# Bunton

**Bunton** is a city of rolling green hills, weeping willows, and perpetual twilight. Nestled in the **Lethian Vales** along the [[Criosia\|Criosian]] border, this "Oracle’s Garden" remains the continent's oldest continuous settlement of human diviners. The city bears the weight of its heritage. Its people regard themselves not as masters of fate but as its penitent custodians, bound to the consequences of bringing foresight to humanity.

## ## History and Geography

Bunton occupies a fertile lowland valley bisected by the **River Leth**. Its geography is metaphysical as well as physical. The valley amplifies psionic and divinatory magic, a trait that drew human settlers during the Era of Settlement.

Here, during the **Unveiling of 125 HC**, humanity communed with the Shadowed Entity to gain the foresight necessary to survive the native wars. Locals view this event with reverent regret, believing the act fractured the natural order.

Following the **Shattering (136 HC)**, the community split. A faction known as the "Ascendants," ancestors of the modern **Singledown** family, abandoned the valley to pursue arcane mastery abroad. The remaining diviners swore the **Covenant of Silence** and formed the isolationist Council of Oracles to guard the valley. During this turmoil, the **Antykera** (the primary artifact of the Unveiling) vanished from the shrines. This loss left a spiritual void that has haunted the city for nine centuries.

### The Annexation of 1036

Bunton refused all outside alliances for nearly a millennium. However, the **Black Eve Massacre** in the neighboring Kingdom of Criosia (1036 HC) shattered their neutrality. Queen Vivianne III's purge secured Criosia as a powerful NUL ally, yet the Council of Oracles feared their neighbor's necromantic influence would swallow them.

To ensure their sovereignty, they signed the **Treaty of the Vales**. This agreement, brokered by the Singledown family (leveraging their influence in both Criosia and Bunton), granted the city full federal statehood. This move placed the Vales under federal jurisdiction, protecting them from becoming a Criosian vassal state while integrating their intelligence network into the allied war effort.

## Society and Politics

The **Council of Oracles**, led by **High Seer Evandra**, governs the city. This circle of interpreters drafts laws based on long-term probabilistic outcomes.

A unique feature of Buntic politics is the **Observer's Seat**, a permanent oversight position held by the **Singledown family**. Historical grievance strains the relationship between the city and the family. Locals view the Singledowns as "Deserters" who abandoned sacred duty for worldly power. Conversely, the Singledowns view the Council as provincial traditionalists clinging to obsolete rituals.

### The Silent Voice

A sub-faction within the city, the **Silent Voice**, practices a radical determinism rooted in the worship of the original Entity. Members take vows of silence to avoid adding "noise" to the timeline. They serve as the city's intelligence analysts and reportedly maintain the empty shrines of the Unveiling deep within the valley forests.

## Economy and Culture

Bunton’s economy is intangible; its primary export is **Information**. NUL generals and politicians pay exorbitant fees for "Certified Forecasts." These magically binding predictions dictate harvest yields or troop movements.

- **Gastronomy:** The Buntic diet is hearty and comforting to counter the damp, cool climate. Public houses serve dark stouts, lamb stews, and soda bread. Local superstition dictates one should always leave the last drop of wine for the "House Spirits."
    
- **Heraldry:** The flag features a single open eye resting beneath a silver crescent moon, set against a field of moss green.
    
- **Magic:** The dominant disciplines are **Augury** and **Probability Manipulation**. Unlike chaotic battlefield magic, Buntic magic is subtle. It manifests as a nudge to a dice roll, a flash of insight, or the reading of patterns in the river mist.
