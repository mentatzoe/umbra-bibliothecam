**Galrea** is the NUL's center for high culture, fashion, and material science. Located in the Argent Highlands of the confederation's western interior, it is a city where industrial mining meets the delicate art of transmutation. Galrea is renowned for its "Sublime Alchemy" (the ability to fundamentally alter the properties of matter) turning iron into silk and stone into glass. It serves as the aesthetic heart of the confederation, dictating trends in art and luxury while supplying the raw materials for the NUL's war machine.

## History and Geography

Galrea is built into the terraced slopes of the **Argent Highlands**, a region riddled with natural geode caverns and veins of magical ore. The city is geographically divided into the **Surface City**, characterized by impossible glass spires and floating gardens, and the **Deep Districts**, a subterranean metropolis of ornate, reinforced tunnels.

The city's demographics shifted radically in **991 HC** following the Llerathian **Purge of Himbadihr**. Thousands of Deep Dwarves (Stone-Kin) fled the imperial massacre in the north. They undertook the "Long March" to the dwarven nation of **Nern Loduhr** in the south-west, seeking sanctuary. When the isolationist kingdom denied them entry, the refugees were forced to cross the continent to the NUL. Galrea, desperate for skilled labor to work the highlands, took them in. Their arrival brought advanced subterranean engineering and metallurgical knowledge, sparking the industrial boom that allowed Galrea to petition for NUL membership in **998 HC**.

## Society and Politics

Governance is held by the **Transmutation Guild**, a meritocratic body led by **Grand Alchemist Elioth Grahn**. Political standing is often determined by one's ability to "Shape. Those who can alter matter hold high office, while those who extract it form the working class.

This dynamic creates a palpable social tension. The Human and Gnome populations dominate the Surface City and the Guild leadership, while the Stone-Kin control the Deep Districts and the **Mineral Syndicate**.

A significant diplomatic hostility exists between Galrea and **Nern Loduhr**. The Galrean Stone-Kin view the isolationist kingdom as traitors for refusing sanctuary during the Purge. Conversely, Nern Loduhr views the Galrean dwarves as "Surface-Tainted," accusing them of selling ancient dwarven secrets to human transmuters and "strip-mining" the soul of the mountain for profit.

## Economy and Culture

Galrea’s economy is a dual engine of **Mining** and **Luxury**. It provides the raw ore for Molheim’s forges and the alchemical fuel for Osterrend’s airships, but its most visible export is culture. Galrean "Transweave" (clothing made from stone transmuted into fabric) is the standard of high fashion across the NUL.

*   **The Chimeric Arts**: Galrea is the only city in the NUL where the creation of **Chimeras** is regulated and legal. Wealthy citizens often parade "Designer Familiars"—small, alchemically fused creatures like winged cats or gem-scaled hounds—as status symbols. The creation of sentient chimeras remains strictly prohibited.
*   **Gastronomy**: Galrean cuisine is experimental and aesthetic. "Amethyst Wine" (grape wine infused with crystal dust) and "Shifting Confections" (desserts that change flavor as they melt) are popular in the cafes of the upper terraces.
*   **Heraldry**: The flag features a golden crucible overflowing with multicolored vapor, set against a field of royal purple.
*   **Magic**: The dominant discipline is **Sublime Alchemy** (Transmutation). Unlike temporary enchantments, Galrean magic focuses on the permanent physical alteration of the subject.
