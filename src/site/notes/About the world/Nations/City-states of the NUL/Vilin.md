**Vilin** is the NUL’s atmospheric fortress, a city of copper spires and jagged peaks where the sky is in a perpetual state of tumult. Known historically as the **Hold of the Sky Marshals**, Vilin specializes in **Fulminurgy** (the mastery of lightning) and atmospheric manipulation. It serves as the primary energy source for the confederation, harvesting raw elemental power to fuel the industrial machines of Dhirdam and the defensive wards of the southern coast.

## History and Geography

Vilin is perched on the **Thunderhead Peaks**, a coastal mountain range notorious for its violent, magical storms. The city’s foundations date back to the **Era of Settlement (c. 100-136 HC)**.

According to local records, the region was first tamed by **Al'Xetahri**, a noble Djinn and ancient Warden who allied with mortals during the elemental wars of the First Century. Following the **Shattering (136 HC)**, Al'Xetahri settled the peaks and taught the indigenous mountain clans the **Art of the Harvest**, the ability to channel lethal atmospheric energy into usable power.

For nearly a millennium, the city was ruled by Al'Xetahri’s lineage, the **House of Xetahr**. This dynasty guided Vilin’s integration into the NUL in **1005 HC**, securing the confederation’s airspace. However, the dynastic era ended abruptly during the **Eradication of 1032 HC**, a catastrophic event at the height of the Second Freedom War that leveled the ancestral Xetahr Hold and scattered the bloodline. In the ensuing power vacuum, the military reorganized into the current **Elemental Conclave**.

## Society and Politics

Governance is held by the **Elemental Conclave**, a meritocratic junta currently led by **Stormlord Khyros Velkan**. The Conclave struggles to balance the city's ancient traditions with the industrial demands of the NUL.

Vilean society is martial and stoic, shaped by the harsh, high-altitude climate. The population includes a significant minority of **Djinn-Descendants** (often called *Wind-Touched*), distinguishable by their faint glowing markings or unnatural hair colors. While once revered as nobility under the Xetahr regime, they are now treated as citizens with a hereditary aptitude for the city's specialized magic.

### The Ruins of the High Hold
The shattered remains of the Xetahr estate still occupy the highest spire of the mountain. The area is a restricted zone, crackling with uncontrolled entropic energy that resists all attempts at repair or purification. It stands as a grim monument to the cost of the Freedom Wars.

## Economy and Culture

Vilin's economy is entirely dependent on **The Harvest**. Massive conductive spires, based on designs left by Al'Xetahri, capture gigajoules of magical energy during the region's perpetual storms. This energy is stored in **Sky Cells** (gem-encrusted batteries) and exported to power the airships of Osterrend and the factories of Dhirdam.

*   **Gastronomy**: The diet is heavy and caloric. Specialties include "Thunder-Roast" (spiced goat meat seared via flash-heat cantrips) and dense root vegetable stews served with dark rye bread.
*   **Heraldry**: The flag displays a jagged yellow lightning bolt cutting through a dark grey storm cloud, set against a field of slate blue.
*   **Magic**: The dominant discipline is **Fulminurgy** and **Kinetic Shaping**. Vilean mages do not simply conjure elements; they redirect existing atmospheric flow, using wind to deflect projectiles and lightning to overload enemy wards.
