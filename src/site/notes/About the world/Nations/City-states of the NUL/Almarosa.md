**Almarosa** serves as the financial heart of the NUL. Located east of Tevara, this volcanic archipelago functions as the "Bank of the Confederation." It is a city of white marble estates, lush tropical rainforests, and immense mineral wealth. While Dhirdam builds the NUL’s future and Osterrend engineers it, Almarosa funds it. Here, noble lineage still holds sway. The aristocracy guards the flow of gold as jealously as the flow of magic.

## History and Geography

Inactive volcanic peaks and jagged cliffs characterize the Almarosan archipelago. The biome features warm, wet tropical rainforests that transition into rocky beaches in the west and sandy shores in the east.

As one of the **Founding Cities** of the NUL, Almarosa proved instrumental in the confederation's formation. It provided the initial capital required to resist Llerathian expansion. Its geography acts as a natural fortress, though rumors persist of Wyrms nesting in the highest dormant calderas.

Historically, the archipelago served as a haven for pirates and smugglers before transitioning into a legitimate mercantile power. This legacy remains visible in the city's aggressive protection of trade routes and the distinct martial pride of its ruling families.

## Society and Politics

The **Almarosan Council** holds governance. In this body, each member heads a specific city system, such as Housing, Transport, or Mining. Traditionally, these seats function as hereditary assets. A councilor controls the contracts for their sector, meaning a change in leadership can shift the flow of millions of Marks.

The Council selects its eldest member as the **Avi** (or Avia). This representative acts as the primary diplomat to the NUL and holds a double vote to break ties.

- **Current Avi:** **Lord Alessio Guerrero** (as of 1046 HC). The Guerrero family has controlled the transportation system since the city's early history.

### Social Stratification

Almarosan society is deeply stratified. While the law considers men and women equal, especially those of noble blood or magical aptitude, the culture remains socially conservative. The "Old Money" families often view homosexuality as a youthful indiscretion rather than a valid adult lifestyle, creating a stifling atmosphere for those who deviate from traditional lineages.

Racial hierarchy also persists. Despite the NUL's egalitarian ideals, the city views **Kobolds** as an underclass. The government restricts them primarily to the mining colonies of **Almacueva**, where they labor to extract the diamonds that fuel the city's wealth.

## Economy and Culture

Almarosa operates as the **Bank of the NUL**. High finance and resource extraction drive the economy. The city holds a commercial monopoly on diamond sales to the **Kingdom of Criosia** and the provinces of **Maraga**. This monopoly is secured by the continent's largest diamond mine.

- **Gastronomy:** The cuisine is seafood-heavy, utilizing tropical fruits and vegetables unique to the archipelago. Famous dishes include **Almapuerto Crab Rice** and the delicacy of **Giant Reef-Frog**, often stewed in spicy coconut milk.
    
- **Heraldry:** The flag is split. One half displays the NUL confederation symbols, while the other identifies the city, set against a field of mauve.
    
- **Magic:** The dominant discipline is **Abjuration** (Warding and Protection). The government strictly regulates magic. Even the purchase of minor artifacts requires a permit, and guards arrest duelists on sight.
    
- **Religion:** Unlike the secular strictness of the mainland NUL, Almarosa permits the display of religious symbols provided they do not disrupt public order.

### Settlements

- **Almacueva:** A mining settlement in the east. It houses the Kobold colony responsible for diamond extraction.
    
- **Almapuerto:** The historic first settlement of the archipelago. This coastal village is renowned for its culinary traditions.
