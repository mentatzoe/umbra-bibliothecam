# Coefort

**Coefort** stands as the NUL’s architectural crown jewel. A city of shifting bridges and cyclopean spires, it anchors the **Falls of the River Vel** upstream from the delta city of Bredapert. Coefort controls the region's freshwater flow and acts as the confederation's hub for **Spatial Arcanum**. Here, magic serves as a building material rather than a mere tool. The city functions as a surveillance state built of stone. Streets realign to manage traffic. Buildings possess rudimentary souls that judge the worthiness of those seeking entry.

## History and Geography

Coefort surrounds the **Vel Rapids**, a series of massive waterfalls where the highlands drop into the coastal lowlands. Historically, this site served as a strategic choke-point for river trade, beginning as a simple toll-fortress.

Over centuries, an influx of wealth transformed the military outpost into a center of high art and magic. The city is famous for **The Paradox Ward**, where **Arcane Zoning Laws** allow buildings to be larger on the inside than the outside. This mastery of spatial folding allowed Coefort to solve the crisis of urban density without expanding its footprint. Architects simply folded new neighborhoods into pocket dimensions.

The city joined the NUL in **998 HC**. While other cities offered raw resources, Coefort offered **Logistics**. Their mastery of teleportation circles allowed the NUL to move high-value personnel and intelligence instantly across the continent, bypassing the slow physical travel of the Llerathian military.

## Society and Politics

**The High Atelier**, a meritocratic council of master architects and enchanters led by **Grand Wright Helene Barath**, holds governance. **Aesthetic Contribution** determines social standing. In Coefort, constructing a structurally unsound or visually discordant building is not merely a faux pas. It is a civic crime punishable by heavy fines.

### The _Domus_ (The Watchful Stone)

The **Domus**, the enchantment of buildings with semi-sentient spirits, defines Coeforti society. A wealthy citizen does not hire guards. They simply live in a fortress that refuses to open its doors to enemies. The city gates, known as **The Judges**, are massive stone faces that psychically scan entrants for hostile intent. They remain shut until the threat is removed. This defense system has created a paranoid society where citizens must constantly project an aura of calm compliance to navigate their own streets.

## Economy and Culture

**Spatial Luxury** drives Coefort’s economy. While the poor travel by foot and the middle class by Osterrendi airship, the elite travel by **Coeforti Gates**.

- **The Transit Web:** The city maintains the NUL’s network of commercial teleportation circles. This service is prohibitively expensive for the masses but essential for the government and wealthy merchant houses.
    
- **Warehousing:** The city exports "Deep-Space" chests and warehouses. These structures utilize extra-dimensional pockets to store massive amounts of cargo in small physical footprints.
    
- **Gastronomy:** Coeforti cuisine obsesses over presentation and structure. Meals are architectural feats. Chefs prepare sugar-spun towers and layered terrines designed to be deconstructed rather than simply eaten.
    
- **Heraldry:** The flag features a golden compass framing a silver gate, set against a field of royal blue.
    
- **Magic:** The dominant disciplines are **Spatial Abjuration** (Teleportation/Dimensional Folding) and **Animus Enchantment** (giving life to inanimate objects).
