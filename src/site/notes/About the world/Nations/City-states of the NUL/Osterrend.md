**Osterrend** stands as the NUL’s cradle of innovation. A coastal city-state renowned for radical multiculturalism and technological supremacy, it serves as the birthplace of the confederation's airship fleet. The city hosts the prestigious AETA (High Technical School of the Artificer). The harmonious integration of Human, Sea Elf, and Dwarven cultures defines Osterrend. It operates with fierce independence, functioning as a collection of autonomous districts rather than a centralized state.

## ## History and Geography

Organic architecture characterizes this coastal metropolis. Sea Elves originally settled the site following the Cataclysm, constructing biomimetic buildings that resemble towering kelp and coral structures. Later colonization by Humans and Dwarves added layers of stone and steel. This history created a unique visual fusion where brass pipes weave through calcified resin towers.

The city stands as one of the Founding Four of the NUL. Its political stance is militantly anti-Llerathian. A common local saying declares, _"An Osterrendi would only want to get close to Llerath to bomb it."_ This aggression stems from the city's dedication to free thought and progress. Locals view these ideals as antithetical to the Imperial theocracy.

## Society and Politics

A City-State Federation model governs the city. Uniquely within the NUL, each neighborhood (The Elven Quarter, The Dwarven Quarter, etc.) governs itself almost independently. Historians credit this lack of a central authoritarian yoke for the city's rapid technological advancement.

Privatized security manages defense. Casa Atlon, in partnership with the Roc Pedramaior Adventurers' Guild, polices the streets. By law, a minimum of 30% of their staff must be current students or graduates of the AETA. This ensures the guards are as magically competent as they are martial.

### The AETA

The High Technical School of the Artificer serves as the city’s crown jewel. As the alma mater of the legendary engineer Dietrich von Kunner, it attracts the brightest minds from across the continent. The school thrives on diversity. Its curriculum blends Elven bio-design with Dwarven metallurgy and Human ambition.

## Economy and Culture

Osterrend functions as the engineer of the NUL. The production of Air Vehicles and high-end artificery drives the economy. The Nhottink Clan, based in the Dwarven Quarter, guards secret metallurgical techniques perfected over centuries. They produce tools and weapons of unmatched quality. Unlike the refugees of Galrea, the Osterrendi dwarves have built their district upon the surface. Their heavy angular stonework provides a stark, grounding contrast to the fluid elven architecture.

- **Gastronomy:** The food culture testifies to the city's fusion. Visitors flock to dwarven confectioneries for heavy pastries and the famous Sahu-Sahu Pies. This savory dish combines rich dwarven butter-crusts with spiced seafood ingredients gathered by the Sea Elves.
    
- **Heraldry:** The flag features a clockwork gear surrounded by a glowing arcane circle, set against a field of sea-foam green.
    
- **Magic:** The dominant disciplines are Artifice and Transmutation. Osterrendi magic is tangible. It is the magic of engines, gears, and bound elementals.
