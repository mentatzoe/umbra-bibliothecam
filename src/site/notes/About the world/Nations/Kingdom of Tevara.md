The **Kingdom of Tevara**, or **Tevara**, is an Eastern kingdom in Tinnuith.

*   **Government:** Hereditary monarchy, currently in interregnum (vacant throne) under the protection of Lord Theodor Esquina. King's seat vacant since King Aquilino Bethelem's death at the [[Battle of Fayhollow\|Battle of Fayhollow]] ("Aquilino's Murder"). No heir postulated.

## Current Events

*   **Wounded Psyche:** Tevara deeply wounded by recent decades, especially [[Battle of Fayhollow\|Battle of Fayhollow]] loss in the Second War with [[About the world/Nations/Llerathian Empire\|Llerath]] and [[About the world/Nations/NUL\|NUL]]. King Aquilino's army devastated. Llerath used Templars, causing firestorm and cinders.
*   **Horror and Anger:** Loss of Tevaran children led to anger, blaming deceased king. Desire for vengeance against Llerath. Prophet stories emerge, promising vengeance. Small rebellion in Fayhollow creates schism.
*   **Broken Society:** Llerath fire caused desert expansion, splitting Tevara. Poor growing conditions. Gnoll raiders from depths cause murder and destruction in kingdom's center. Refugees flood south, abandoning western cities/towns. Limited trade with [[About the world/Nations/Kingdom of Sansi\|Sansi]] overland. Trade routes to [[About the world/Nations/Principate of Kylthen\|Principate of Kylthen]] or [[Maraga\|Maraga]] cut off by Gnolls.
*   **Fragile Balance:** Kingdom fragile, no power to push back Gnoll Warhost. West March abandoned, misery in former prosperous cities. Followers of the Four Paths aid both people and the land, but the kingdom severely weakened, decades to recover.

## Geography and Commerce

*   **Northern Tevara:** Mostly jungles, few hidden kingdoms. Alpaca fur trade with [[About the world/Nations/Kingdom of Sansi\|Sansi]] and [[1.DMing Assets/DRAFTS - Worldbuilding and brainstorming/Almarrosa - draft\|Almarrosa - draft]]. Some fruits/plants, little other known wealth.
*   **Eastern Coast:** Small sea towns and cities for sailors, fishermen, traders. Trade houses weakened, but gained power due to aristocratic losses.
*   **Southern Cities:** Hold landed gentry and farms. Towns/cities full of refugees cared for by nobles and alms houses (financed by kingdom patriots who spy on nobles). People favor helping citizens, but resent refugees not working northern lands. Deserted zone cities/towns/hamlets taken by gnolls, fiends, horrors. Gnoll raids on populated towns, Tevaran factions organize defenses/incursions.

## Notable Factions

*   **Theodorians (Aristocratic Faction):**
    *   Control Tevara, colloquially named Theodorians.
    *   Historical control via capital Manai. Control agriculture/farmlands.
    *   Power in south, keep country fed. Aim to restore monarchy (heir search slow).
    *   Led by Lord Theodor Esquina (economic/political power, holds Spear of Tevara - sovereign symbol).

*   **Merchant Companies:**
    *   Protect/tax east shore trade routes. Rivals to aristocrats.
    *   Shrewd merchants with mercenary armies (pirate history). Capable politicians.
    *   Want Tevara as confederation, blame state on poor economy/technology. Leader unclear.

*   **Tevaran Volunteers:**
    *   Support merchants. Former soldiers/veterans, disgruntled with aristocracy, poor military record.
    *   Led by Commander 'Old' Amihan Loras (national hero, protects caravans/refugees from Gnolls, holds Glade of Maniel - sovereign blade heir).

*   **Order of the Righteous Path of Good (Paladins):**
    *   Kingdom-wide paladin organization. Protect refugees/weak, rebuild Tevara.
    *   Work with all factions, apolitical, support common good. Possibly religious.
