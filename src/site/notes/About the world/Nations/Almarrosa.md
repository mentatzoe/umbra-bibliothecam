# Almarosa City

## Population

    * The population is condensed in the city of Almarosa, the archipelago mostly uninhabited with the exception of a few other settlements.

## Main language or languages

## Politics
* **Local government**
    * The city has a council that decides on the matters related to their local government.
    * Each member of the Council acts as a head of the different systems of the city: housing, transport, culture, taxes, utilities, security, commerce, and mining.
        * Traditionally, these systems have belonged to a particular noble family. In most cases the one that originally funded it. As the councilmember in charge of the system decides on the contracts to maintain it, a change in council could bring economic ruin .
    * To become a council member, a previous representative must have stepped down or died. Once a vacancy is available, a process opens to fill that spot. The process is based on a set of tests, and requires the applicant to have a guarantee from one of the noble families.
    * The council selects its oldest member as Avi or Avia, who acts as a representative to address the population.
        * This person's vote counts twice in case of a tie.
        * The current Avi, as of 1046, is Lord Alessio Guerrero. The Guerrero Family have been in charge of the transportation system since the pirate days of Almarosa.
