The **Orcish Confederation of Votar Tok** is not a unified state.

*   **Structure:** Warfas (orc groups) roam lands in varying sized encampments. Towns relocate when resources deplete. Tribes compete for resources (food, weapons, warriors - male and female).
*   **Culture:** Developed, but society unchanged over time. Tools/weaponry evolve via foreign kingdoms.

## Origins

*   **Tradition:** Ancients entered Votar Tok jungles, settled in poisonous/creature-filled depths. Survived, reproduced, became Orcish tribes. Strong, resilient, band together for survival. No recorded history before Kunjiong.

## Kunjiong

*   **Dwarven Expedition:** Third Dwarven Expedition ventured north to Votar Tok, establish jungle foothold at mountain base. Expedition settled at delta of river/archipelago. Remote location allowed Engineers undisturbed work on fortified citadel on delta's largest island (staging dock for expansion). Bridge to mainland, protected by fortified hill (ballistas, catapults, crossbows).
*   **First Orcish Warfa Attack:** Legend: First Orcish warfa (Xue-tuan) ventured west, found citadel. Poor attack plan, storming fortified hill, hundreds of warriors lost. No dwarven deaths. Word spread, warfas gathered to challenge. Many attacks failed, slopes littered with bodies. Warriors joked about emptying quivers. Only achievement: warfa unification to take "Kunjiong" citadel. Embarrassment.
*   **Warmaster Huang-Shi:** First Warmaster emerged (Huang-Shi warga). Duels with warchiefs, unified 10,000 force. Zhou-shi warfa retreated to jungle. Week-long dwarven defense prep, hill fortification, ammunition stocking. Orcish assault at dusk. Orcish host built wheeled wooden walls for cover. Dwarves used ballistas on wall wheels. Defenses broke, temporary cover for advancing host. Orcs broke ranks at nightfall, ladders from makeshift walls, climbed walls. Dwarven crossbow defense, reserves: axes/tools. Few dwarven warriors. Dwarves pushed back with pride, first wave held (significant cost). Citadel bells rang. Secondary warfa force used night/rafts, took undefended citadel walls. Citadel slaughter, hill defenders retreated. Brave soul burned foundation supports to deny hill. Fort crumbled, horde took city.
*   **Huang-Shi's Reign:** Huang-shi crowned first warmaster, warmaster of citadel. First/only sedentary warfa of Orcish Warhold.

## The Dara-Han (The Great Mountain)

*   **Huang-shi's War:** First act: war on dwarven clans to prevent Kunjiong repeat. Host south, assaulted mountain ranges. Raids butchered towns/fortresses. Salted valleys, soiled rivers with bodies, prevent regrowth. Collapsed caves, sometimes filled with dwarfs. Merciless butchering, useful raids. Hundreds of weapons returned (swords, hammers, axes, bows, crossbows). Huang Shi armed guards with crossbows at fortress.
*   **Skull Marking:** Host scorched 12 miles inland, marked limits with fallen enemy skulls. Dara mountain summit meeting (Orcish name, different dwarven name). Fifteen warlords planned future. Invasion threat to Votar Tok real. Regional distributions arranged, lost to time. Three laws created, ingrained in Orcish culture.
    *   **Law of Tianxia:** Votar Tok invaded by foreign army, warbands unite under Kunjiong keeper against foe.
    *   **Law of Shokugeki:** Foreign lands, warchief contested by another orc for warfa takeover, prevent warfa blood spilling.
    *   **Law of Xuedun:** Winter end, clan banishes two warriors ("Xuedun") to neighbor warfa, share culture/blood ties.
*   **Dara Han Laws Sealed:** Laws agreed by 15 chieftains, blood pact on Dara mountain. Obelisk raised, warchiefs bloody handprints on monolith. Dara Han laws never forgotten.

## The Dara-Shi (The Great Clan)

*   **Post-Dara Han:** Fifteen warfas returned, tradition life continued. Borders shifted, inter-warfa wars common (warrior race). Relative happiness in population. Xuedun often miserable, some notorious warriors in new warfas. Warfas entrenched, small fortifications. Smuggling, caravan raids. Large armies temporary (blood ties/agreements), dissolved quickly (purpose done/infighting).
*   **Huang-shi Warfa:** Only warfa relatively unscathed. Generations in fort, protected, planned raids to weaken rivals. Weaponry advantage (dwarven raids), entrenched position, upper hand in conflicts. Tactical warriors, complex challenges, weapon variety. Shields marked with crescent iron moon, glaives, crossbows, short swords.

## The Expulsion of Lao Shin

*   **Lao Shin's Unification:** Lao Shin (Lao-ying warfa warchief, northernmost warfa). Raids on elven kingdom, unified northern clans without Kunjiong emissaries (Tianxia law break). Huang-shi outrage, other warfa shock. Lao Shin expelled from Votar Tok (Kunjiong war council), warfa invader in warhold. Half northern clans outraged, joined Lao Shin against elven woodlands. (1) Lao Shin died in battle, warfa taken by Tse-hua, died later in brawl to Deng-Xie (Deng-shi warfa name).

## Warring Clans

*   **Deng-shi Raids:** Deng-shi shifted focus from elven woodlands south, raiding Xie-lu for human kingdom riches. Fortress towns pillaged (high casualties), power diminished. Local clans warfas joined defense, balance of power, defense reduced capacity to raid east Votar Tok.

## Great War / The Dazhan Companies

*   **Huang-Da Zhan's Initiative:** Great War start, Huang-Da Zhan gathered 15 largest clan warchiefs in Kunjiong. Discussed war start, policy on outside kingdoms. Warchiefs disagreed on action (glory, weapons, power benefits). Huang-Da Zhan suggested mercenary companies for hire (strict condition: no orc battalion vs. orc).
*   **Mercenary Companies Hired:** Companies hired by [[Llerath\|Llerath]] and [[NUL\|NUL]]. Orcs strategically sound (assault troops, disrupt entrenched positions, demoralize enemy). Shokugeki law suspended outside Votar Tok for companies. "Llerath-shi" and "Null-shi" companies (joke names) high casualties, thousands of orc deaths in foreign lands. Weapons/treasure flowed back, warband entrenchment. Easier to find armor than body to fill it.

## Suoding (Kingdom Closure)

*   **Votar Tok Closure:** Votar Tok manpower loss. Huang-Xi closed borders to merchants/foreign kingdoms, warchiefs avoid bloodshed. No Orcish raids out. Objective: enough orcs in Votar Tok for defense. Tianxia law extension, sanctioned by notable warfas. Four decades, orcs internal fighting only, avoided outside world. Communication ceased, orcs abroad assimilated, contention point, race/culture protection priority.

## The Xiji (The Raids)

*   **Eastern Clan Raids:** Orcish numbers recovered, Eastern clans ambition to end Huang-Xi mandate, began raiding [[Criosia\|Criosia]] for spoils. Unprepared villages, easy prey for mounted raiders (wealth, weapons, women). Influx grew Eastern clans disproportionately, fortresses perimeter in east (trading hubs). Nomadic clans ventured out, resided between [[Criosia\|Criosia]]/Votar Tok. No backlash yet, future change possible.
