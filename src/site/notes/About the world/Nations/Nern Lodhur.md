**Nern Lodhur**, the ancient Dwarven kingdom, anchors the southwestern tip of Tinnuith. Isolated by the sheer peaks of the **Titan's Spine** and the dangerous waters of the Southern Ocean, this nation defines itself by impenetrable borders and deep-seated traditionalism. While neutral in the conflict between the NUL and Llerath, Nern Lodhur remains locked in a cold, centuries-old hostility with the **Orcish Confederation of Votar Tok**. To outsiders, the kingdom resembles a closed fortress. It opens its gates only for commerce or to send forth its young on the sacred **Pilgrimage of the Horizon**.

## History and Geography

The kingdom lies carved directly into the granite roots of the **Titan's Spine**. This mountain range acts as a natural wall against the northern Orcish territories of Votar Tok. The capital, **Lodhur-Deep**, functions as a subterranean metropolis extending miles beneath the surface. Vast fungal forests and deep-earth lakes render the city entirely self-sufficient.

The **Fall of Kunjiong** scars Nern Lodhur's history. Centuries ago, the **Third Dwarven Expedition** established colonial fortresses deep in the northern jungles. The loss of these strongholds to the Orcish Warmaster **Huang-Shi** marked the end of Dwarven expansionism. Since that defeat, Nern Lodhur has adopted a policy of "Stone and Silence." They fortified their home range and refused to engage in surface politics. This isolationism became visibly cruel in **991 HC** when the High Thane refused sanctuary to refugees fleeing the Llerathian Purge. This rejection forced the displaced kin to migrate east to the NUL city of Galrea.

## Society and Politics

The **High Thane** and the **Council of Elders**, representing the major clans, hold governance. Politics in Nern Lodhur remain conservative and slow-moving. The law prioritizes the Clan over the Individual and the Past over the Future.

Despite their isolation, Lodhurian society maintains a unique release valve known as **The Pilgrimage**. Upon reaching maturity, the clans exile many young dwarves to the surface world for a period of ten to fifty years. Elders task them with traveling the continent to learn a trade, master a martial art, or acquire a specific truth. They may rejoin the clan as full adults only when they return with something of value, whether gold, a new spell, or a masterwork creation. This tradition ensures that the kingdom's knowledge base never stagnates despite its closed borders.

### The Watch of the Peaks

While nominally at peace with the NUL and Llerath, Nern Lodhur views its northern border as a dormant front line. For the last four decades, the Orcish policy of **Suoding** (closed borders) has quieted the mountain passes. However, Dwarven Rangers and **Rune-Priests** remain vigilant. They view the silence of Votar Tok not as peace but as a preparation for war. Skirmishes still occur when rogue _Warfas_ (Orcish warbands) test the defenses of the mithral mines.

## Economy and Culture

The economy is insular but wealthy. Nern Lodhur possesses the continent's only active **Mithral** mines. They trade this precious metal with the NUL (specifically AlSaib and Molheim) in exchange for foodstuffs and timber. However, merchants must conduct all trade at the **Gate of Strangers**. This fortress-market on the border marks the line where non-dwarves are forbidden to pass.

- **Gastronomy:** The diet is subterranean and preserved. Staples include salted cave-fish, mushroom loaf, and **Stone-Ale**. Brewers ferment this drink in geode casks for decades until it achieves the consistency of syrup.
    
- **Heraldry:** The flag features a silver mountain peak on a field of black crossed by a gold pickaxe.
    
- **Magic:** The dominant discipline is **Rune Magic**. Unlike the fluid spellcasting of the surface, Lodhurian magic is hammered into existence. Artisans carve runes into armor, weapons, and even skin. These markings provide permanent, passive enchantments that require no concentration to maintain.
