The **Llerathian Empire** is a theocratic nation located in a mountainous region, bordered to the south by the Eldengroth Mountains, and the Kingdom of Sansi. Founded in 991 (Year 0 Under the Light), after the Cataclysm nearly destroyed the Northern Kingdoms, Llerath is a nation deeply devoted to order and structure, guided by the Goddess Lucis Aeternitas, known as Lux. The empire's history is marked by conflict and expansion, notably the [[0.World/Separation of Sansi and Lubnice\|annexation of the Protectorate of Lubnice in 1018 (1016-1018)]] and the devastating First and Second War against the Free Nations. These conflicts have shaped Llerathian society, culture, and military, fostering a sense of isolationism and a deep distrust of outsiders.

### History

Llerath's history is marked by the Cataclysm, a devastating event that led to the ascension of Lux as a goddess in 984. Under her guidance, the empire was established, ushering in an era of peace, prosperity, and strict adherence to order. The Llerathians believe that chaos is the ultimate enemy and strive to maintain a society free from its influence. However, this pursuit of order has led to conflict with neighboring nations, particularly the Free Nations, who view Llerath's expansionist tendencies and theocratic rule with suspicion and hostility.

The annexation of Lubnice, initially a protectorate, was a turning point in Llerathian history, solidifying the empire's dominance in the region but also fueling resentment among the people of Sansi, who saw it as a betrayal of their shared heritage. This event further strained relations between Llerath and the Free Nations, ultimately culminating in the Second Freedom War, a devastating conflict that left deep scars on both sides. The war ended with the eradication of the Xetahrs in 1032, but the tensions between Llerath and the Free Nations remain unresolved.

### Geography

Llerath is characterized by its mountainous terrain, providing natural defenses and isolation. The capital city, also named Llerath, is nestled among the highest peaks and serves as the religious and political center of the empire. The empire encompasses a variety of landscapes, from fertile valleys and terraced farmlands to volcanic regions and dense forests. Each region has its own unique cultural traditions and historical influences, contributing to the rich tapestry of Llerathian society.

- **Llerath (Capital):** The heart of the empire, home to the grand temples and administrative centers. Its architecture is a testament to Llerathian devotion to Lux, with gleaming white marble structures and intricate friezes depicting scenes from mythology and history.

### Politics

Llerath is governed by a theocratic system, with the Goddess Lux as the ultimate authority. The government is divided into seven branches: Interior (Root Council), Exterior (Bloom Council), Defense (Thorn Council), Mind (Sapling Council), Body (Fruit Council), Illumination (Council of the Light), and Intelligence (Beehive). Each branch is led by an appointed Prima Mater, except for the Defense branch, which is now led by a Primus.

The conflicts with the Free Nations have had a profound impact on Llerathian politics. The annexation of Lubnice and the subsequent war have led to increased militarization and a heightened sense of paranoia within the government. The Thorn Council, responsible for defense, has gained more prominence, while the Exterior (Bloom) Council, responsible for diplomacy, has struggled to maintain relations with other nations. The political climate is tense, with a growing faction within the government advocating for a more aggressive stance towards the Free Nations.

### Military

The Llerathian military is a well-organized and disciplined force, primarily focused on defending the empire's borders and maintaining internal order. The Thorn Council oversees the military, ensuring the empire's protection from both internal and external threats. The military is divided into specialized units, each with its own unique training and tactics. The Inquisitors, members of the Illumination branch, also play a crucial role in the military, using their magical abilities to combat threats to the empire.

The wars with the Free Nations have had a significant impact on the Llerathian military. The losses suffered in the Second War, particularly the devastating defeat at Tiberang in 1036 UL, have led to a reevaluation of military tactics and a greater emphasis on magical warfare. The Inquisitors have become even more integral to the military, their powers seen as essential in the fight against the perceived chaos of the Free Nations. The military is now constantly on high alert, with fortifications and patrols strengthened along the borders.

### Culture

Llerathian culture is deeply rooted in the worship of Lux, [[0.World/Llerathian Scriptures\|the scriptures]], and the pursuit of order. The people are known for their discipline, selflessness, and dedication to the empire. Magic is strictly regulated, with only Inquisitors, members of the Illumination Branch, allowed to wield it under the Goddess's blessing.

The conflicts with the Free Nations have further solidified these cultural values. The Llerathians view their enemies as agents of chaos, and their military actions as a necessary defense against this threat. This has led to a hardening of attitudes towards outsiders and a reinforcement of the empire's isolationist tendencies. The arts, literature, and even cuisine have become increasingly focused on themes of patriotism, duty, and the glorification of Lux. The Spring Offering, a series of challenges for aspiring templars, has taken on a new significance, with a greater emphasis on combat training and the development of magical abilities.

The Llerathian Empire is a complex and fascinating nation, shaped by its unique history, geography, and cultural values. Its conflicts with the Free Nations have had a profound impact on its society, politics, and military, creating a nation that is both deeply devout and fiercely protective of its way of life. The empire's future remains uncertain, but its unwavering faith in Lux and its commitment to order will undoubtedly continue to guide its path.
