The Vesper Crusaders, an ancient order of paladins, are sworn to uphold balance and order in the world. 

Bathed in the radiant hues of the aurora, they draw their power from the celestial energies that dance across the sky. 

It is said that the Custodian and the rest of the pantheon left them in the world with the sacred oath to preserve the natural order and the wellbeing of its people. 

Although they are elves who are presumed to have lived for millennia, they have always been sworn to protect any people, no matter what. 

Each knight was bound by a sacred oath, represented by their unique colour, and they wield their powers with unwavering devotion to their cause. 

These oath leaders aren't lone wolves, often having multiple knights under their wing.

The oaths are set to protect the following:
1. Nature - all the flora
2. Night - And the rest and respite that all things deserve (and the moons and their changes)
3. Animals - The fauna and the ecosystems needed for life to exist in equilibrium
4. Exchange - The exchange between cultures that allowed all to be richer, be it through commerce, politics...
5. People - All of the peoples in the world, their knowledge, and their right to express their differences and particularities

The leaders were the following elves:
* Bel'dach - An avid lover of painting, with long blonde locks and green eyes. Soft-spoken, but stern in self-discipline. His armor has green accents to evoke his dominion.
* Shael - A pale-faced, slim knight, who is incredibly dexterous and stealthy. He enjoys dancing traditional Eldengrothian dances. Black is used as an accent in his armour as a reference to the darkness of the night.
* AlauniÃ« - A strong-bodied knight, of wide frame, olive skin and dark long hair who has grown always close to the gentle elvish cattle herding traditions. Her voice, frequently in song, is deep and velvety. Red is the colour of the accent in her armour, for the blood of the beasts she must protect.
* Aurelius - A tall, strong and slender knight, with short golden hair, and a chiseled profile. She is often seen in the company of important players in the political panorama of the world, regardless of their status. Her ability to play any known instrument and delect people with their favourite tunes has often won her entries behind doors that would be closed to most mortals. Gold is her accent, a representation of the abundance she is sworn to protect.
* Siniy - Short and scrawny, it would be easy to believe that Siniy belonged to an order of scholars rather than one of knights. But behind the body of a wizard hides the resilience of an athlete, and Siniy has frequently proven the rest of the team that he's the one who can endure the longest in any sort of physical challenge. As is his duty to understand and protects what creates both difference and similarity, he is often found reading all sorts of manuscripts and writing compendiums and notes for those who might come behind him and wonder about the gaps that history might have left. Who knows, he might even be the author of this humble entry!

Some of their most famous feats stands as follows:
* They orchestrated the communion of peoples during the Great Wars, organizing the initial resistance against the human colonizers, and then uniting forces against the redacted.
* Imprisoned and sealed the terrible Lich Vivianne, who changed forever the path of the people of Criosia - ensuring that her essence would be forever bound to those she hurt the most, and that no being - living or undead - would ever be able to help her.
* They stopped the slaver trading to the outer planes by traitors to the material planes.
* Assisted the giants with escaping the cursed lands of the north during the calamity
* Helped secure the neutral lands a peace treaty during the Freedom Wars
* Supported the creation of the 4 Paths
* Helped prevent the eruption of civil war in the Kingdom of Sansi after the coronation of King Catalino I
