The War between [[Llerath\|Llerath]] and the [[Free Nations\|Free Nations]] was a protracted conflict marked by raids and skirmishes between both factions. While many viewed it as the typical power struggle between two large empires, the true motives lay in a cross-plane battle to contain ruinous forces.

## Conflict Overview

### The Great Raid on [[Tevara\|Tevara]]

Concerns grew within the court of [[Tevara\|Tevara]] over the king's decision to allow an excavation at the Temple of **[name missing]**. Soon after, ill omens troubled the region:

- A flock of birds fell dead from the sky, hitting the ground in unison.
- Wells produced water darker than usual, with a strong taste of iron.

Court wizards and the [[Order of the Righteous Path of Good\|Order of the Righteous Path of Good]] warned the king about the excavation’s dangers. However, the king prioritised providing local citizens work and the wealth from excavation licenses over the ominous signs.

Frustrated by inaction, members of the court reached out to the courts of Sansi, Maraga, and Lubnice. These well-meaning leaders feared aligning with the Free Nations and warned of unclear motives. Their warnings fell on deaf ears, except for **Anniken Buen**, who immediately saw the deeper threat posed by the excavation. He escalated the issue to the northern-most court, directly to **Lux Aeterna**.

## Llerath's Response

Upon hearing the news, the **Grand Army of Llerath** swiftly mobilized under the command of **Mother [name missing]** and marched south. Llerathi ambassadors sped across the land, informing kings and warchiefs that their army’s intent was to stop an escalation by the Free Nations. However, most perceived this move as an outright power grab.

After crossing the borders of Lubnice and Maraga, Llerath's army entered Tevara. An emissary from the King of Tevara was sent to parlay with **Mother [name missing]**, who demanded the Free Nation excavation team leave Tevara. She also insisted on stationing a permanent guard of Llerathi troops at the temple, with local compensation provided for the intrusion. The emissary rejected these terms, declaring Llerath's actions tantamount to war.

## Battle at Tiberang

As word spread of the Llerathi Grand Army’s movements, the Free Nations quickly organized a response. They sent reinforcements to the King of Tevara, including:

- Weapons and armor
- Potions
- Newly developed gunpowder weapons

The army, retrained within two weeks, was placed under the command of the King of Tevara himself.
### Duel of Champions

Both armies met near the village of **Tiberang**. Following tradition, the leading champions of each army dueled:

- **Sir Zacharias Costales** of Tevara wielded an enchanted great sword that emitted flames with every strike.
- **Mother Anwin** of Llerath wielded a Llerathian Halberd, fitting her rank.

After two hours of intense fighting, **Mother Anwin** decapitated **Sir Zacharias**, securing victory for Llerath. The Great Army roared in triumph, but Tevara’s forces unleashed a devastating opening salvo from their new cannons, killing many Llerathi veterans.

In retaliation, **Mother Anwin** issued a no-quarter order, a first in Llerath's history. Llerathi magic-wielders unleashed destructive spells, turning kilometers of land into a scorched, frozen wasteland. The victory was complete, with few survivors.

## Siege of the Temple

The Great Army marched south in silence, leaving desolate towns and villages in its wake. Upon reaching the Temple of **[name missing]**, a stone-and-wood circumvallation was created to prevent any escape. **Mother [name missing]** made a final attempt to negotiate with the excavation team, but her plea was met with a cryptic message, which she promptly burned.

A siege began. **General [name missing]** of the Free Nations led the excavation team, guarded by warriors equipped with sophisticated weaponry never before seen by Llerathi forces. These weapons decimated the Llerathi elite squadrons during initial incursions.

The excavation team raised a defensive spell shield over the temple and continued operations. Desperate, **Mother [name missing]** summoned the remaining magic-wielders for advice on destroying the shield. While some suggested an anti-magic field, others warned of the dangers of releasing whatever was safeguarded within the temple.

## The Catastrophe

Under the cover of night, the Llerathi army retreated, leaving behind a small force of veterans and spellcasters. A beam of immense power was summoned, tearing through the shield and temple alike. The resulting destruction left the lush jungle a barren wasteland. The excavation team had anticipated the attack and teleported away before the beam struck.

Now, only desolation remains. No one can hear the sinister laughter that emerged from the ruined temple.
