Sansi, a northern kingdom in the continent of Tinnuith, is renowned for its fertile farmlands and culinary delicacies. Recently emerging from a bloody civil war, the kingdom is rebuilding and adapting to a new political landscape. Sansi, located south of the imposing Eldengroth mountain range, was once a larger nation, but the western region of Lubnice seceded in 1018 UL (Under the Light), aligning itself with the [[World/Llerathian Empire\|Llerathian Empire]]. This event, coupled with internal strife, plunged the kingdom into a period of uncertainty and conflict.
### Geography and Economy

Sansi's landscape is diverse, ranging from majestic mountain ranges and dense forests to fertile plains and barren badlands. This variety has shaped the kingdom's economy, with agriculture playing a central role. Sansi is a breadbasket kingdom, producing a wide array of grains, fruits, and vegetables that are prized throughout Tinnuith. Its culinary traditions are celebrated across the continent, with the annual Cerdanza festival in Simpa showcasing the finest cold cuts and delicacies. The city of Simpa is also known for its vibrant arts scene, with two competing guilds, the Three Chimneys and the Safe Travels Guild, offering diverse goods and services. While agriculture is the backbone of Sansi's economy, it also has a limited industrial output, specializing in textiles and leathers.

### Government and Politics

The kingdom of Sansi is currently ruled by King Catalino I of the Dominguez dynasty. The recent civil war, which saw the King's forces, including the Cheese Company and the orcish army led by Guan Dao, triumph over the Barberistas, has solidified his claim to the throne. However, the political landscape remains complex. The presence of Guan Dao's orcish forces in Sencia has created new tensions, and the Queen Mother, Helena Mulinterno, continues to be a powerful and influential figure in the court.

### History

Sansi was founded by human settlers who migrated to the region centuries ago. The first king, Jaime I, established the Barbero dynasty, which ruled the kingdom for many generations. The secession of Lubnice and the subsequent civil war marked a turning point in Sansi's history. The conflict resulted in the dissolution of the King's Horns, a royal order of knights, and the imprisonment of Queen Helena, who was later accused of treason. The recent victory of King Catalino I, aided by the Cheese Company and Guan Dao's forces, has ushered in a new era for Sansi, but the kingdom's future remains uncertain.

### Culture and Traditions

Sansi's culture is a blend of human traditions and influences from neighboring regions. The people of Sansi are known for their love of good food, their lively festivals, and their appreciation for the arts. The Cerdanza festival in Simpa is a major cultural event, showcasing the kingdom's culinary prowess. The city of Simpa is also a hub of artistic expression, with its two competing guilds offering a wide range of crafts, entertainment, and services. The religious landscape of Sansi is diverse, with the worship of Lux, the Llerathian goddess of light and order, gaining traction in recent years, especially among the nobility.
