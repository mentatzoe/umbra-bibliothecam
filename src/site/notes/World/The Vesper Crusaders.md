The Vesper Crusaders are an order of paladins in the continent of Tinnuith sworn to uphold balance and order in the world. 

The Custodian created them with the sacred oath to preserve natural order and the well-being of all inhabitants of the continent, so they have existed since the beginning of times. 

Each knight is bound by a sacred oath, represented by a colour that evokes the aurora, the sunset only they're meant to see when the gods turn the lights off. 

The oaths are sworn to protect the following:
- **Nature:** The flora of Tinnuith: From the towering trees of the ancient Eldengrothian forests to the delicate sentient wildflowers that bloom in the pastures of Votar Tok.
- **Night:** Rest, the stillness that brings rest and renewal, and the moons with their dance across the velvet sky.
- **Animals:** The fauna that sustains the balance of the natural world.
- **Exchange:** Cooperation between diverse cultures, ensuring that the flow of knowledge, commerce, and diplomacy enriches all.
- **People:** The cultures of the world, the rights and freedoms of every individual.

Although presumed to have lived for millennia, these elven knights have always been sworn to protect all individuals, regardless of their origins. 

The oath leaders, described in the following list, are not solitary figures. They often take multiple knights under their wing.

* **Bel'dach -** An avid painter with long blonde locks and piercing emerald eyes. Bel'dach sees the world as a canvas, seeking harmony and balance in every brushstroke. 
	* His soft-spoken demeanour and toned body speak of self-discipline and continuous training. 
	* His armour, adorned with verdant accents, reflects his deep connection to the natural world.

* **Shael -** Shael moves through the shadows like a whisper on the wind, his dark features reflecting the twilight. 
	* His mastery of stealth and agility is matched only by his passion for the rhythmical traditional dances of Eldengroth. 
	* Silver is used as an accent in his armour to reference the moon that breaks the darkness of the night he protects.
  
* **AlauniÃ« -** A strong-bodied knight, of wide frame, olive skin, and dark long hair who has grown always close to the gentle elvish cattle herding traditions. 
	* Her voice, frequently in song, is deep and velvety. 
	* Red is the colour of the accent in her armour, for the blood of the beasts she must protect.
  
* **Aurelius -** A tall, strong and slender knight, with short golden hair, and a chiseled profile. She is often seen in the company of important players in the political panorama of the world, regardless of their status. 
	* Her ability to play any known instrument and delectate people with their favourite tunes has often won her entries behind doors that would be closed to most mortals. 
	* Gold is her accent, a representation of the abundance she is sworn to protect.
  
* **Siniy -** Short and scrawny, it would be easy to believe that Siniy belonged to an order of scholars rather than one of knights. Behind the body of a wizard hides the resilience of an athlete, and Siniy has frequently proven to the rest of the team that he's the one who can endure the longest in any physical challenge. 
	* His armour has blue accents to symbolise the wisdom of the people he's sworn to protect. 
	* As his duty to understand and protect what creates difference and similarity, he is often found reading all kinds of manuscripts and writing compendiums and notes for those who might come behind him and wonder about the gaps that history might have left. His quill may have penned this very entry, never to offer anything but the truth. 

Some of their most renowned feats include:
* They orchestrated the communion of peoples during the Great Wars, organising the initial resistance against the human colonisers, and then helped broker peace between all the different players of the war against ~~REDACTED~~ a quick onset of chaos that drove all dragons mad and would have escalated to the end of all things.
  
* Imprisoned and sealed the terrible Lich Vivianne, who changed forever the path of the people of Criosia - ensuring that her essence would be forever bound to those she hurt the most and that no being - living or undead - would ever be able to help her.
  
* They halted the trafficking of slaves to the outer planes by traitors from the material plane, and disrupted the reign of terror brought by Sultan Hasseki.
  
* Assisted the giants with escaping the cursed lands of the north during The Calamity that threatened to engulf the continent into the Abyss.
  
* Helped secure a peace treaty for the neutral lands during the Freedom Wars.
  
* Supported the establishment of the Four Paths.
  
* Helped prevent the eruption of civil war in the Kingdom of Sansi after the coronation of King Catalino I.
