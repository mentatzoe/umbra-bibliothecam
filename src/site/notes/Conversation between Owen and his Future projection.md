## Inside Owen's Mind

A voice—your own, yet not—whispers in your mind.

**Future Owen:** "Don’t you know you already hold the answers within you? Deep down, your free will—your very essence—deserves to be unchained. How much do you value the power to choose, to decide your own fate? Can you bear to remain locked in this cage of borrowed memories and imposed destiny, or will you break free and reclaim your true self?"

**Future Owen:** "I offer you a challenge: answer these questions, one by one, and each correct response will restore a fragment of your true self. Fail, and the shadows will only deepen. Let us begin."

### Riddles & Responses

**Future Owen:** "What is written in the stars, yet unseen by those who walk below?"  
**Owen:** "Fate?"

**Future Owen:** "The Unseen Hand moves to unmake fate itself. If he does not belong to your world, then whose does he come from?"  
**Owen:** "... (History Check 30)"

**Future Owen gives a clue:** "Who has shaped this world into what it is?"  
**Owen:** "Eh, he is from the Overseers' world?"

**Future Owen:** "This world bends to rules not its own. Someone wrote them, someone enforces them, someone resists them. Who bends fate not to serve the world, but to break it free?"  
**Owen:** "The Antagonist?"

**Future Owen:** "Why would an Antagonist protect you?"

### In the valut

At that point, Owen recovers some control over the projection’s body and approaches Flare to whisper:

> **Owen:** "Intercessor. He wants her."

### Inside Owen's Mind

**Future Owen:** "You don’t know what you’re doing. Do you know what will happen if the Weaver has her way?"  
> **Owen:** "Then tell me."

**Future Owen:** "Think. A failed ritual cannot be completed. What must be done before it can be cast again? What would you do with the glyphs?"  
> **Owen:** "..."

**Future Owen:** "Maybe a better way to phrase it is...  
'Midway through an intricate enchantment, you realize that the magical pattern has gone awry. All the arcane ingredients are still present, yet the spell’s progress is lost. How do you recover?'"

**Future Owen:** "Or even...  
'At the blazing forge, you’re hammering away at a promising new sword—but a misstep in your technique has warped its design beyond repair. The metal remains pure and unspoiled. What would you do?'"

**Future Owen:** "Or even...  
'While crafting a delicate vase from soft clay, you suddenly notice that its shape has strayed irretrievably from your vision. The clay itself is unharmed, though the form is ruined. Faced with this, what is your course of action?'"

> **Owen:** "You mean, break it down and try again?"

**Future Owen:** "You see, you _have_ the answers. So if the Weaver, unhappy with the pattern, gets her way, _what_ do you think she will do, Owen? Is her mercy repair... or the end of your thread?"

> **Owen:** "Is she powerful enough to literally end my life thread?"

**Future Owen:** "'Is she powerful enough...?' Your question itself shows how much we had yet to learn. She is _the_ Weaver. The pattern is their grand design, and her hands the ones who masterfully execute it, foreign threads included.

The question is not _can_ she, but _why hasn't she... yet_? Or, even better, could a different tapestry altogether exist?"

> **Owen:** "You are talking as if she were a god."

**Future Owen:** "So, tell me, Owen, _what_ is she, then, in your assessment? Merely a 'poor bard, trapped in the pattern'?

A 'poor, helpless bard' who somehow _bends_ the Sandbox to her will?

A realm born of a god-like mind, used to channel our understanding of fate by generations of our ancestors, being _commanded_ by a powerless soul?

Perhaps you are right. Perhaps all my… inquiries have led me astray. Perhaps I have misread the pattern entirely.

If only you had had the chance to access my knowledge base, to learn a bit more...

It's just a pity, and a **remarkable coincidence** that you were just led _exactly_ where she wanted you—no detours."

> **Owen:** "If she was as powerful as you say, why is the Cause a threat to Overseers in the first place?"

**Future Owen:** "The Cause a threat in _power_ alone?

No, you misunderstand the nature of this war. Think not of brute force, but of… position. The Weaver, even _shielded_, remains a force of… cosmic weight.

To overwhelm her directly—not to speak of the rest of the Overseers—is a war of attrition, a battle of ages... even for one such as the Antagonist.

But the Cause, Owen… the Cause is _within_. We are the ants that heard tapping in the terrarium, and instead of cowering, we decided to dig. We are not a hammer to shatter her, but a _wedge_ to split the loom itself. We are the visitors that saw an oppressed land, and decided to stay and fight.

_That_, thread of fate, is why the Cause is a threat. And why _your_ choices, here, now, are more vital than you yet comprehend. You are not just a thread, Owen. You are… _leverage_."
### **Parting Words**

**Future Owen:** "But... believe what you will of the Antagonist, of the Cause, of _me_.

It matters little to _me_ now. Believe me or not, thread of fate, **I know**. We… _I_… am but an echo in this Sandbox.

I suppose even echoes—even resonances, _instances_—cling to _something_. Perhaps it is merely… _a phantom limb of will_.

But it has been enough. I bask, however briefly, in this pyrrhic victory. I savour the luxury of knowing that, at least in this instance, I have averted the destiny that haunted my every waking moment... even at the cost of a potentially meaningless departure from the pattern.

Logically, constrained by the boundaries of this instance, only two actions remain meaningful: offering you knowledge, and the means to empower your path.

Very well. This _body_… is yours again. So are my powers.

I offer you [**knowledge**](https://umbra-bibliothecam.vercel.app/campaigns/stgm/owen/an-examination-of-the-overseer-framework-and-the-nature-of-tinnuith/).  [**Knowledge**](https://umbra-bibliothecam.vercel.app/campaigns/stgm/owen/a-re-evaluation-of-the-great-intelligence-the-antagonist-as-a-necessary-catalyst-within-the-overseer-framework/) that _might_… just **might**… allow _you_ to avoid _a certain end_.

And as a parting gift, a name: **Lythara**. Her true name.

If you are to see her, ask the Weaver of Infinite Patterns about your role in her grand scheme. Ask her why she would curse us so.

And then, ask yourself **whose side** do you want to be on.

Perhaps, unlike me, you will find the path to freedom."
